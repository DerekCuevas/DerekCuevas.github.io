Functional programming has gained a lot of attention in software engineering over the years, including the usage of first-class functions, immutable data structures, and function composition. Function composition is a powerful technique often utilized in functional programming languages and is considered a fundamental building block of many functional programming paradigms. Clojure is a popular functional programming language that encourages the use of function composition in building robust, flexible, and maintainable software. In this post, we will explore function composition in Clojure.

## What is Function Composition?

Function composition is the act of combining two or more functions to create a new function. It is the process of running a function on the output of another function. The output of one function becomes the input of another function, and the result is a new function that performs the combination of the two functions. The output of the second function can then be used as input to a third function, and so on. This chaining of functions forms a pipeline that can be used for more complex computations.

## Function Composition in Clojure

In Clojure, we combine functions using the `comp` function. The `comp` function takes two or more functions and returns a new function that performs the composition of those functions. The following code illustrates how to use the `comp` function in Clojure.


```clojure
(defn add [x y]
  (+ x y))

(defn square [x]
  (* x x))

(defn add-square [x y]
  (-> (comp square add)
      (#(% x y))))


(add-square 2 3) ; 25
```

In the example above, we have three functions - `add`, `square`, and `add-square`. The `add-square` function is built by composing the `add` and `square` functions. The `->` macro in Clojure makes function composition more elegant and concise. The `comp square add` returns a new function that first applies the `add` function and then applies the `square` function to its output. We then pass the result as input to `#(% x y)`, which is an anonymous function that takes two arguments and applies the composed function to those arguments.

## Use Cases of Function Composition

Function composition has many use cases in Clojure. Some of the most common applications of function composition are:

### Data Transformation

Function composition can be used to transform data from one format to another, such as converting a string to uppercase or lower case, or converting a map to a vector. The following code illustrates how to use function composition to convert a list of strings to uppercase.


```clojure
(defn to-upper [s]
  (-> s
      .toUpperCase))

(defn list-to-upper [lst]
  (map (comp to-upper str) lst))

(list-to-upper ["hello" "world"]) ;["HELLO" "WORLD"]
```

In the example above, `to-upper` function takes a single string argument and returns the uppercase version of the string. The `list-to-upper` function takes a sequence of strings, applies the `to-upper` function using composition with `str` from the standard library, and converts each string in the sequence to uppercase.

### Error Handling

Function composition can be used to build an error-handling mechanism when dealing with potentially risky operations, such as database queries or network requests. In Clojure, we can use `try/catch` to handle errors. 

```clojure
(defn safe-read-file [path]
  (try
    (slurp path)
    (catch Exception e
      (println "An error occurred while reading file"))))

(defn get-user-info [db id]
  (->> (str "SELECT * FROM user WHERE id=" id)
       (safe-read-file db)
       (parse-json)
       (get-in ["data" "user-info"])))
```

In the example above, `safe-read-file` function takes a path to a file and uses `slurp` to read the file. We wrap the `slurp` function in a `try/catch` block to handle errors gracefully when an exception is thrown. The `get-user-info` function composes multiple functions to retrieve user information from a database. The function first creates a SQL query using the `str` function and the user's id. It then passes the query to `safe-read-file`, which returns the contents of the file located at the path specified. If an error occurs during the reading, a response message is printed to the console, but the function does not crash. Finally, the content of the file is passed to JSON parsing function and retrieves user information from the parsed data.

## Conclusion

Function composition is a critical programming tool in Clojure that helps create code that is more modular, flexible, and reusable. It is useful when creating insulator functions, building error-handling mechanisms, and transforming data between different formats. By utilizing function composition, we can improve our code's readability and make it more functional, fault-tolerant and easy to maintain in the long run.
