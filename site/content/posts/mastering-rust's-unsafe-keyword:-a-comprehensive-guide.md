When working with Rust, it is impossible to avoid the `unsafe` keyword entirely. Rust's strict ownership and borrowing rules make it possible to write safe code, but in certain situations, mainly when working with low-level system programming, `unsafe` is necessary.

This guide will delve into the Rust `unsafe` keyword and show how to use it safely. We will work through some examples and best practices for writing `unsafe` code in Rust.

## What is `unsafe` code?

Rust's `unsafe` keyword allows the programmer to bypass Rust's usual safety checks. Using `unsafe`, it is possible to write code that is not checked at compile-time for safety. It is still subject to run-time checks, however. The `unsafe` keyword lets you:

- Dereference raw pointers
- Call unsafe functions or methods
- Mutate static variables
- Implement unsafe traits

The `unsafe` keyword is also necessary when working with FFI (Foreign Function Interface) function calls.

While using `unsafe` might seem alarming at first glance, Rust's syntax for declaring unsafe blocks is designed to make it very clear to both the programmer and compiler that unsafe operations are taking place.

## Understanding Rust's Unsafe Guidelines

Despite its name, `unsafe` code can be safe, but only if used carefully and correctly. To ensure safety, Rust has a set of guidelines for working with `unsafe` code, which include:

### 1. There should be only a small amount of `unsafe` code

The goal of Rust's `unsafe` guidelines is to minimize the overall amount of `unsafe` code, making it easier to reason about the program's safety.

### 2. Unsafe code should be isolated

Rust's guidelines recommends isolating all `unsafe` code to specific modules, functions or blocks. This keeps the unsafe code appropriately wrapped up, allowing the safe code to remain safer than it would be if mixed with the unsafe code.

### 3. Unsafe code should have a clear contract

Rust's `unsafe` guidelines mandate that `unsafe` code should have clear and concise documentation providing detailed information on what the code does, what its pre and post-conditions are, and how it must integrate with the safe code.

## Writing Safe `unsafe` Code in Rust

With a clear understanding of the Rust `unsafe` guidelines, it's essential to know how to write the `unsafe` code itself safely. Here are some best practices to keep in mind when working with `unsafe` code:

### 1. Isolate the `unsafe` code

First and foremost, follow the guideline to isolate the `unsafe` code to specific modules, functions, or blocks. Preferably only unsafe functions with well-defined entry and exit points should be used, or even better put the unsafe code within a module and create only safe functions that work with it.

### 2. Write clear documentation

Include clear documentation or comments for the `unsafe` API to outline assumptions and any potential invariants. This documentation should help users understand what they need to do to make sure the API is safe to use.

### 3. Use safe abstractions

Itâ€™s best to use safe abstractions and libraries wherever possible instead of implementing the unsafe code yourself. There are many existing libraries, often part of Rust's standard library, that provide the unsafe facilities you should use wherever possible.

### 4. Use tests to validate the behavior of the code

Like everything else in Rust, `unsafe` code is supported by Rust's test capabilities. Testing helps to ensure the `unsafe` code behaves correctly, making its use as safe as possible.

### 5. Check for correctness and bugs

To ensure `unsafe` code is safe to use, make sure to check it thoroughly for correctness and potential bugs. Use tools such as `valgrind`, `ASan` or `UBSan` to get as much validation as possible.

## Conclusion

Understanding `unsafe` code is important when working with Rust's lower-level systems and has clear guidelines for its usage. With the best practices outlined in this guide, it should now be possible to use `unsafe` code to create high-performance systems with confidence.
