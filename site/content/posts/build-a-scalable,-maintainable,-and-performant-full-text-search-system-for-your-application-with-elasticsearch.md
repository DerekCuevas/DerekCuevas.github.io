If you’re building an application with a lot of text-based content such as articles, comments, user-profiles, messages, or product information, using a full-text search engine is an excellent way to provide an advanced search functionality for your users. Elasticsearch is a popular, distributed, and highly scalable search engine based on the Apache Lucene library that allows for complex search queries and real-time indexing and search. In this article, we’ll show you how to build a scalable, maintainable, and performant search system for your application using Elasticsearch.

## Why Elasticsearch?

There are many benefits to using Elasticsearch for full-text search in your application. Some of these benefits include:

- **Scalability**: Elasticsearch is distributed by nature, so it’s easy to scale horizontally as your data grows.
- **Real-time indexing and search**: Elasticsearch allows for near-instant indexing and search of new documents.
- **Full-text search**: Elasticsearch easily handles large amounts of text-based content, and provides advanced full-text search capabilities such as fuzzy search, phrase search, proximity search, etc.
- **Aggregation and analytics**: Elasticsearch provides powerful aggregation and analytics capabilities, so you can use it for more than just search.

## Setting up Elasticsearch

Before we dive into the details of how to use Elasticsearch in your application, let’s first cover how to set it up. Elasticsearch can be run on-premises or in the cloud, but for the purpose of this article, we’ll show you how to set up a single Elasticsearch instance locally. 

Here are the steps to do that:

1. Download Elasticsearch from the official download page - [https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch).
2. Extract the downloaded package to a directory of your choice.
3. Navigate to the Elasticsearch bin directory and start Elasticsearch by running the following command: 
```bash
./elasticsearch
```
4. Verify that Elasticsearch has started successfully by opening a web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:9200/](http://localhost:9200/). You should see a response like this:
```json
{
  "name" : "your-elasticsearch-instance-name",
  "cluster_name" : "elasticsearch",
  "cluster_uuid" : "random-uuid-here",
  "version" : {
    "number" : "7.10.0",
    "build_flavor" : "default",
    "build_type" : "tar",
    "build_hash" : "51e9d6f22758d0374a0f3f5c6e8f3a799a5dbdb",
    "build_date" : "2020-11-09T21:30:33.964949Z",
    "build_snapshot" : false,
    "lucene_version" : "8.7.0",
    "minimum_wire_compatibility_version" : "6.8.0",
    "minimum_index_compatibility_version" : "6.0.0-beta1"
  },
  "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
}
```

## Indexing Data

Once you have Elasticsearch set up, the next step is to index your data. In Elasticsearch, data is organized into indices, which are essentially logical collections of documents with similar properties. An index can be thought of as a database table in a relational database.

To create an index, you can use Elasticsearch’s REST API, which allows you to perform various actions on Elasticsearch using HTTP requests. Here’s an example of how to create an index called `my_index`:

```bash
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/my_index?pretty"
```

Once you have an index, you can start adding documents to it. A document is a basic unit of information in Elasticsearch, and is similar to a row in a database table. Here’s an example of how to add a document to the `my_index` index:

```bash
curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/my_index/_doc/1?pretty" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "My Document Title", "body": "This is the body of my document."}'
```

This will add a new document to the `my_index` index with an ID of `1`. You can add more documents to the index by changing the ID.

## Searching Data

Now that we have data indexed in Elasticsearch, we can start searching it. Elasticsearch provides a powerful search API that allows for complex queries and filtering.

Here’s an example of a simple search query that searches the `my_index` index for documents that contain the word `body` in the `title` field:

```bash
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/my_index/_search?q=title:body&pretty"
```

This will return a JSON response with information about the matching documents.

### Query DSL

Elasticsearch’s search API also supports a powerful Query DSL (Domain Specific Language) that allows for more complex queries and filtering. Here’s an example of how to search the `my_index` index for documents that contain the word `body` in the `title` field or the `body` field, and return only the `title` field in the response:

```bash
curl -X GET "localhost:9200/my_index/_search?pretty" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
           "query": {
               "multi_match" : {
                   "query" : "body",
                   "fields" : ["title", "body"]
               }
           },
           "_source": ["title"]
         }'
```

This will return a JSON response with only the `title` field for matching documents.

## Conclusion

Elasticsearch provides a powerful, scalable, and feature-rich search engine that is ideal for full-text search in applications. In this article, we’ve shown you how to set up Elasticsearch, index data, and search data using Elasticsearch’s REST API and Query DSL. With Elasticsearch, you can build a robust search system for your application that provides real-time indexing and search, advanced query capabilities, and scalability as your data grows.
