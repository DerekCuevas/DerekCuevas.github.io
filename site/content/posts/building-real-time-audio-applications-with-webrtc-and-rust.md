WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communications) is an open-source project that enables real-time communication between web browsers and mobile applications using voice, video, and data. In this post, we will explore how to use Rust to build real-time audio applications on top of WebRTC. We will walk through the steps required to build a simple web application that communicates audio in real-time between two clients using Rust, WebSockets, and WebRTC.

## WebRTC Internals

WebRTC is a collection of APIs and communication protocols that allow real-time communication between browsers, mobile devices, and desktop applications. The WebRTC APIs enable the following features for real-time communication:

- Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
- Mobile-call applications
- Videoconferencing
- Audio and video mixing
- Screen sharing
- File transfer

The WebRTC APIs expose a number of individual components and modules that developers can use to customize their applications. These components and modules include:

- RTCPeerConnection (used to establish and manage communication sessions)
- RTCDataChannel (used for arbitrary data transfer)
- MediaStream (used for managing audio and video streams)
- RTCIceCandidate (used for handling network connectivity issues)
- RTCSessionDescription (used for handling media session descriptions)

In this post, we will be focusing on the `MediaStream` component as the basis for real-time audio communication.

## Setting up the Client

The first step in building our real-time audio application is to set up the client-side application. We will be using the `webrtc-echoes` crate to provide the WebRTC communication functionality for our Rust web application. We will use `websocket`, a parallel crate in Rust for implementing real-time browser-to-browser communication. We will also require the `wasm-pack` tool, which will compile our Rust code to WebAssembly.

In Terminal, run:

```bash
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo generate --git https://github.com/Placenio/webrtc_echoes
cd webrtc_echoes
cargo install wasm-pack
```

Next, change your directory to `client/` and run:

```bash
wasm-pack build --out-name wasm --target web
```

This will build a new Rust library with our client-side code, which can be consumed in a web browser.

## Building the Server

The second step in building our real-time audio application is to set up the server. The server will communicate between the clients, handling WebSockets communication and relaying audio via the `webrtc-echoes` crate.

In Terminal, run:

```bash
cargo init server
cd server
```

Add the following dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
webrtc-echoes = "0.3.2"
tokio = { version = "1", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.64"
async-tungstenite = "0.13.0"
```

We will use the Tokio runtime to manage all the async tasks. Next, create a new file `main.rs` and add the following code:

```rust
use async_tungstenite::{tokio::TokioAdapter, WebSocketStream};
use futures::{sink::SinkExt, StreamExt};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use tokio::io::{AsyncRead, AsyncWrite};
use webrtc_echoes::{message::SignalingMessage, rtc::AudioService};

async fn handle_connection(ws: WebSocketStream<TokioAdapter<impl AsyncRead + Unpin + Send>, impl AsyncWrite + Unpin + Send>, audio_service: AudioService) {
    let (mut ws_sender, mut ws_receiver) = ws.split();

    while let Some(msg) = ws_receiver.next().await {
        let msg = msg.unwrap().into_text().unwrap();
        let signaling_message: SignalingMessage =
          serde_json::from_str(&msg).unwrap();
        audio_service.handle_signaling_message(signaling_message)
            .await.map_err(|e| println!("Error handling signaling message: {}", e))
            .unwrap();
        let message = audio_service.get_signaling_message();
        let message =
            serde_json::to_string(&message.unwrap()).unwrap();

        ws_sender.send(message.into()).await.unwrap();
    }
}

async fn run_server() {
    let audio_service = AudioService::new();
    let mut listener = tokio::net::TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await.unwrap();

    let mut incoming = listener.incoming();
    while let Some(stream) = incoming.next().await {
        match stream {
            Ok(stream) => {
                println!("New WebSocket connection: {:?}", stream);
                let ws_stream = TokioAdapter::new(stream);
                tokio::spawn(handle_connection(ws_stream, audio_service.clone()));
            }
            Err(e) => {
                println!("Error accepting WebSocket connection: {}", e);
            }
        }
    }
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    run_server().await;
}
```

This server code example sets up a WebSocket listener on port 8080. The `handle_connection` function establishes a connection with `webrtc-echoes` and passes audio data between the clients.

## Conclusion

In this post, we have covered the basics of building real-time audio applications using Rust, WebSockets, and WebRTC. We explored how to set up the client-side and server-side of our application and leveraged Rust's performance benefits to provide fast and reliable communication between clients. With the ever-growing demand for real-time communication functionality, the WebRTC API has become a valuable tool for developers to create new and innovative applications.
