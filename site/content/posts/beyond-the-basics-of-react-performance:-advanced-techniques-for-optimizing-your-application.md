# Beyond the Basics of React Performance: Advanced Techniques for Optimizing your Application

React is an excellent JavaScript library for creating well-structured and efficient user interfaces. The React team has focused on optimizing the core library, but there are certain advanced techniques that can be employed to further improve the performance of your application. In this article, we will explore some of these techniques and see how they can be used to efficiently render and update components.

## Memoization with React.memo

React.memo is a higher-order component that can be used to “memoize” a component. Memoization is a technique used to optimize expensive function calls by caching their results and returning the cached value for subsequent calls with the same input. In React, memoization can be used to prevent re-renders of expensive components by caching the previous result and returning it if the input props have not changed.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const ExpensiveComponent = ({ data }) => {
  // ... expensive logic
}

export default React.memo(ExpensiveComponent);
```

In the example above, if the props passed to ExpensiveComponent have not changed, the memoized version will simply return the previous result from cache instead of re-executing the expensive logic.

## Using State Correctly

The state of a component is one of the key factors that affect performance in React applications. Correct usage of state is important to ensure that the application performs efficiently.

### Use setState Callbacks

setState is an asynchronous function in React that updates the state of a component. It can take a callback function as a second argument that is executed after the state has been updated. Using this callback can help avoid some common performance issues.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Component = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const handleClick = () => {
    setCount(count + 1, () => {
      // do something after count has been updated
    });
  };

  // ...
};
```

In the example above, using the callback ensures that the additional code is only executed once the state has been updated.

### Avoid Storing Computed Values in State

Storing computed values in state can lead to additional re-renders and negatively affect performance.

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Component = ({ data }) => {
  const [average, setAverage] = useState(computeAverage(data));

  // ...
};
```

In the example above, any update to the data prop will result in a re-render of this component, even if the average has not changed. Instead of storing the average in state, it is better to compute it directly in the render method.

## Use the Virtual DOM Correctly

React’s virtual DOM is a key feature that provides the basis for efficient component rendering. However, the way in which it is used can impact performance.

### Use List Keys

When you are rendering a list of components in React, each component must have a key prop set to a unique value. This helps React identify which components have changed and avoids unnecessary re-renders.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const List = ({ items }) => (
  <ul>
    {items.map((item) => (
      <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);
```

In the example above, the key prop is set to the id of the item object.

### Avoid Expensive Operations in render()

The render() method in a React component should only contain the code required to render the component. Any additional processing or calculations should be done in other methods.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const Component = ({ data }) => {
  const processData = () => {
    // expensive processing
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {processData()}
    </div>
  );
};
```

In the example above, the expensive data processing is being done in the render method, which will cause it to be executed on every re-render. Moving this processing to a separate method and only calling it when required can help improve performance.

## Conclusion

In this article, we discussed some advanced techniques that can be used to optimize React performance. By using memoization with React.memo, setState callbacks, avoiding storing computed values in state, using list keys, and avoiding expensive operations in the render() method, you can ensure that your React application runs efficiently and smoothly.
