Consistent Hashing is a popular algorithm used in distributed systems for data partitioning and load balancing. It provides a way for distributed systems to efficiently scale and handle high volumes of data and requests. In this post, we'll go over the basics of Consistent Hashing and implement it in Rust.

## What is Consistent Hashing?

Consistent Hashing is a technique used in distributed systems to hash keys onto a ring of nodes. This ring is partitioned into slots, and each node is assigned one or more slots. When a key needs to be accessed, its hash is calculated, and the corresponding slot on the ring is located. The data associated with that key is then looked up on the node assigned to that slot.

One of the key benefits of Consistent Hashing is that it is resilient to node failures and additions. As nodes are added or removed from the system, the load is redistributed across the nodes in a smooth and efficient manner. Only the data assigned to the affected nodes needs to be moved.

## Implementing Consistent Hashing in Rust

We can start by implementing a simple hash function that takes a key and returns a u64:

```rust
fn hash(key: &str) -> u64 {
    let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();
    key.hash(&mut hasher);
    hasher.finish()
}
```

The `DefaultHasher` is a built-in hash function in Rustâ€™s standard library. Now we can use the hash function to assign nodes to slots on the ring:

```rust
struct Node<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
    slots: Vec<u64>,
}

impl<'a> Node<'a> {
    fn new(name: &'a str) -> Node<'a> {
        Node {
            name,
            slots: Vec::new(),
        }
    }

    fn add_slot(&mut self, slot: u64) {
        self.slots.push(slot);
    }

    fn remove_slot(&mut self, slot: u64) {
        if let Some(idx) = self.slots.iter().position(|x| *x == slot) {
            self.slots.remove(idx);
        }
    }
}

struct Ring<'a> {
    nodes: BTreeMap<u64, Node<'a>>,
}

impl<'a> Ring<'a> {
    fn new() -> Ring<'a> {
        Ring {
            nodes: BTreeMap::new(),
        }
    }

    fn add_node(&mut self, name: &'a str) {
        let node = Node::new(name);
        self.nodes.insert(hash(name), node);
    }

    fn remove_node(&mut self, name: &'a str) {
        self.nodes.remove(&hash(name));
    }
}
```

In our example, we create a `Node` that contains a name and an array of `slots`. We then create a `Ring` using a `BTreeMap` with the key being the `hash(name)` and the value being the `Node`. The `add_node` method adds a new node to the ring, and the `remove_node` method removes a node from the ring.

Next, we need to implement the algorithm for locating the node and slot for a given key:

```rust
fn locate<'a>(&'a self, key: &str) -> Option<(&'a str, u64)> {
    if self.nodes.is_empty() {
        return None;
    }

    let key_hash = hash(key);
    let node = self
        .nodes
        .range((Included(&key_hash), Unbounded))
        .next()
        .or_else(|| self.nodes.iter().next());

    if let Some((_, node)) = node {
        let slot = node
            .slots
            .iter()
            .find(|&&slot| slot >= key_hash)
            .unwrap_or_else(|| &node.slots[0]);

        Some((node.name, *slot))
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

We first check that the ring is not empty. We then use `range` to find the next node starting from the hash of the key. If there is no next node, the first node in the list is used instead. Once we have the node, we find the slot on that node that is greater than or equal to the hash of the key. If no such slot exists, we wrap back around to the beginning of the ring.

## Conclusion

Consistent Hashing is a useful algorithm for improving the scalability and resilience of distributed systems. In this post, we implemented a simple Consistent Hashing algorithm in Rust. Our implementation uses a `BTreeMap` to store the ring of nodes and `hash(name)` to map nodes to slots on the ring.
