Rust is a systems programming language that offers a powerful set of abstractions for building high-performance network applications. In this post, we'll take a closer look at the `net` module of the Rust standard library and explore some of the most important APIs and data types that this library provides for network programming.

## The TcpStream Type

The primary way to create a TCP connection in Rust is through the `TcpStream` type, which represents a single stream socket that can read and write data. To establish a new TCP connection to a given IP address and port, we can use the `TcpStream::connect` function, as shown in the following example:

```rust
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::net::TcpStream;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let mut stream = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:8080")?;
    stream.write_all(b"Hello, world!")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Here, we create a new `TcpStream` instance by calling the `TcpStream::connect` function and passing it the string "127.0.0.1:8080", which represents the IP address and port of the server we want to connect to. If the connection is successful, we can then write data to the stream using the `Write::write_all` method.

## The TcpListener Type

On the server side, we can listen for incoming TCP connections using the `TcpListener` type. This type represents a socket that listens for incoming connections and accepts them in a loop. To create a new `TcpListener` instance and start listening for incoming connections, we can use the `TcpListener::bind` function, as shown in the following example:

```rust
use std::io::prelude::*;
use std::net::{TcpListener, TcpStream};

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?;

    // accept connections and process them in a loop
    for stream in listener.incoming() {
        match stream {
            Ok(stream) => {
                // connection succeeded
                println!("New connection: {}", stream.peer_addr()?);
                handle_client(stream)?;
            }
            Err(e) => {
                // connection failed
                eprintln!("Error: {}", e);
            }
        }
    }
    // close the socket server
    drop(listener);
    Ok(())
}

fn handle_client(mut stream: TcpStream) -> std::io::Result<()> {
    // read data from the stream
    let mut buffer = [0; 512];
    stream.read(&mut buffer)?;
    println!("Received: {}", String::from_utf8_lossy(&buffer[..]));
    // write data back to the stream
    stream.write_all(b"HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n<html><body><h1>Hello, world!</h1></body></html>")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Here, we first create a new `TcpListener` instance by calling the `TcpListener::bind` function and passing it the string "127.0.0.1:8080", which represents the IP address and port to bind to. We then use the `incoming` iterator to accept incoming connections in a loop, and for each accepted connection, we spawn a new thread to handle the connection. In this example, we simply read data from the stream and write a simple HTTP response back to the client.

## The UdpSocket Type

In addition to TCP sockets, Rust also provides support for UDP sockets through the `UdpSocket` type. This type represents a UDP socket that can send and receive datagrams. To create a new `UdpSocket`, we can use the `UdpSocket::bind` function, as shown in the following example:

```rust
use std::net::UdpSocket;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    let socket = UdpSocket::bind("127.0.0.1:34254")?;
    let mut buf = [0; 10];
    let (amt, src) = socket.recv_from(&mut buf)?;
    let buf = &mut buf[..amt];
    buf.reverse();
    socket.send_to(buf, &src)?;
    Ok(())
}
```

Here, we first create a new `UdpSocket` instance by calling the `UdpSocket::bind` function and passing it the string "127.0.0.1:34254", which represents the IP address and port to bind to. We then use the `recv_from` method to receive a datagram from the socket and the `send_to` method to send the datagram back to the source address.

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored some of the most important APIs and data types provided by the Rust standard library's `net` module for network programming. We covered how to create and establish TCP connections using the `TcpStream` type, how to listen for incoming TCP connections using the `TcpListener` type, and how to send and receive datagrams using the `UdpSocket` type. With these building blocks, you should have a solid foundation for building high-performance network applications in Rust.
