Real-time chat applications have become a crucial component of many web platforms as they facilitate communication between users engaging in a conversation within a single interface. From customer support to social networks and gaming, chat applications require quick and efficient two-way communication.

In this tutorial, we'll use Node.js, WebSocket, and Redis to build a real-time chat application that can serve multiple users simultaneously. We'll explore the WebSocket protocol that enables full-duplex communication between the server and the client. Then we'll integrate Redis, a fast and efficient key-value store that enables you to store, retrieve, and analyze data in real-time.

## Prerequisites
To follow this tutorial, you need a basic understanding of JavaScript, Node.js, and asynchronous programming. Familiarity with Redis and the WebSocket protocol will also be useful.

## Step 1: Setting up the project
Before starting, make sure to install Node.js and Redis on your machine. You may also want to set up a new directory for your project. Begin by running `npm init` to initialize a new node project.

Next, install the necessary Node.js dependencies. We'll use `express`, `ws`, and `redis` packages.

```
npm install express ws redis
```

## Step 2: Creating the server
Now that the project is set up, let's create the server that will handle WebSocket connections from clients. First, create a new file called `server.js` and add the following code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const http = require('http');
const WebSocket = require('ws');

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

const port = 8080;

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  console.log('Client connected');

  ws.on('message', (data) => {
    console.log(`Received message ${data}`);
    wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
      if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
        client.send(data);
      }
    });
  });

  ws.on('close', () => {
    console.log('Client disconnected');
  });
});

server.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server started on port ${port}`);
});
```

First, we require the necessary libraries for creating an HTTP server and a WebSocket server. We create an instance of `express`, the `http` module, and then instantiate a WebSocket server using `ws`.

Next, we instantiate the server with the given port number and set up the events for messages, connections, and disconnection. When a client sends a message, we forward it to all other connected clients. Finally, we listen to the specified port and log a message when the server starts.

## Step 3: Creating the client application
Let's create a simple HTML page with some JavaScript that connects to the WebSocket server we just created. Create a new file called `index.html` and add the following HTML code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>Real-time Chat Example</title>
</head>
<body>
  <ul id="messages"></ul>
  <form id="form" action="">
    <input id="input" autocomplete="off">
    <button>Send</button>
  </form>

  <script>
    const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');

    socket.onopen = function () {
      console.log('WebSocket connection established');
    };

    socket.onmessage = function (event) {
      const messages = document.getElementById("messages");
      const li = document.createElement("li");
      li.appendChild(document.createTextNode(event.data));
      messages.appendChild(li);
    };

    document.querySelector('#form').addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
      event.preventDefault();
      const input = document.querySelector('#input');
      const value = input.value.trim();
      if (value === '') {
        return;
      }
      socket.send(value);
      input.value = '';
    });
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

This code creates a WebSocket connection with the server, logs a message when the connection is established, and renders incoming messages in real-time. It also sets up a form to send messages to the server when the user hits the Send button.

## Step 4: RabbitMQ for scaling
Our chat application is now functional and can handle WebSocket connections from multiple clients. However, it can only operate locally at this point, and we need to use message queues and real-time data streaming to enable scaling.

There are many Message Queuing and Streaming tools available to enable real-time scalability for chat applications. In this tutorial, we'll use RabbitMQ as our message queue tool.

First, you need to install RabbitMQ on your machine, you can download it from the official website, https://www.rabbitmq.com/. Follow the installation guide to configure RabbitMQ on your machine.

After RabbitMQ is installed and running on your machine, we need to install the amqplib package to the project.

```
npm install amqplib
```

Next, we have to modify our code to send and receive messages from the message queue. Replace the following code in `server.js`:
```javascript
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });
```

With the following code:
```javascript
const amqp = require('amqplib/callback_api');

const RABBITMQ_URL = 'amqp://localhost';

amqp.connect(RABBITMQ_URL, (error, connection) => {
  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }

  connection.createChannel((error, channel) => {
    if (error) {
      throw error;
    }

    channel.assertQueue('chat', {
      durable: false
    });

    const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ server });

    wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
      console.log('Client connected');

      ws.on('message', (data) => {
        console.log(`Received message ${data}`);
        channel.sendToQueue('chat', Buffer.from(data.toString()));
      });

      ws.on('close', () => {
        console.log('Client disconnected');
      });
    });
  });
});
```

We now establish the RabbitMQ connection in the server using the `amqplib` library. We create a connection to the RabbitMQ server and open a channel using the `createChannel` method. 

When a message is received, we send it to the `chat` queue in the message queue using the `sendToQueue` method.

## Step 5: Consuming messages from the message queue
Our messages are now being added to the RabbitMQ message queue, but we still need to consume them from the message queue to forward them to connected clients. 

We'll use the same RabbitMQ connection to listen for new messages using the following code:

```javascript
amqp.connect(RABBITMQ_URL, (error, connection) => {
  if (error) {
    throw error;
  }

  connection.createChannel((error, channel) => {
    if (error) {
      throw error;
    }

    channel.assertQueue('chat', {
      durable: false
    });

    channel.consume('chat', (msg) => {
      wss.clients.forEach((client) => {
        if (client.readyState === WebSocket.OPEN) {
          client.send(msg.content.toString());
        }
      });
    });
  });
});
```

We listen for new messages in the `chat` queue using the `consume` method. When a new message arrives, we send it to all connected WebSocket clients.

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we built a real-time chat application using Node.js, WebSocket, and Redis. We started by creating the WebSocket server that handles communication between clients. Then, we created a simple HTML page that connects to the WebSocket server and renders messages in real-time.

Finally, we scaled our application using RabbitMQ, a message queuing tool, to enable real-time data streaming and scaling. We converted the client-server architecture into an event-driven messaging architecture using RabbitMQ. 

This application can serve as a solid foundation for building your own real-time chat application, and you can extend it by adding more features such as user authentication, message history, and real-time analytics.
