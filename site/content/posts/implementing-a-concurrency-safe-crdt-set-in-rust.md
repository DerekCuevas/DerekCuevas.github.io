In this expert-level post, we will dive deep into the realm of `Rust` and distributed systems to implement a `Concurrency Safe Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT)` Set. CRDT sets are highly interesting to study and use due to their ability to handle conflicting updates and maintain consistency across distributed systems, making them an ideal choice for modern fault-tolerant and scalable applications.

Let's begin by having a quick glance at what a `CRDT` is.


## Introduction to CRDT

A `CRDT` or `Conflict-free Replicated Data Type` is a type of data structure that has found significant applications in distributed data storage systems. They maintain consistency across multiple replicas, even in the event of network partitions or latency. The `Concurrency Safe CRDT` Set that we will implement in this post has the property that every replica can update independently without coordination and any conflicting updates will be resolved deterministically with an eventual consistency model.


## A Basic Implementation

Let's start with defining the struct for our CRDT set. We'll hold our set data in a `HashMap` where the key is the set element and the value is a counter (or version number) that will aid in resolving conflicts.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
   
struct CrdtSet {
    set: HashMap<String, u64>,
}
```

To make it functional, we first need methods to add and remove elements from the set. The `add` operation increases the counter for an item, and `remove` operation only succeeds if the items exist in the set with exactly the same counter.

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
   
struct CrdtSet {
    set: HashMap<String, u64>,
}

impl CrdtSet {
    fn new() -> Self {
        CrdtSet {
            set: HashMap::new(),
        }
    }
    
    // adds an element to the CRDT set
    fn add(&mut self, item: String) {
        let counter = self.set.entry(item).or_insert(0); // default counter to 0
        *counter += 1; // increment the counter
    }
    
    // removes an element from the CRDT set
    fn remove(&mut self, item: &String, version: u64) -> bool { 
        match self.set.get(item) {
            Some(&counter) if counter == version => {
                self.set.remove(item);
                return true;
            },
            _ => return false,
        }
    }
}
```


Now, let's make our CRDT set concurrency-safe by implementing a merge function.

## Making CRDT Set Concurrency Safe

The essential property of a CRDT set is that it can be updated independently on different nodes, and any conflicts are resolved when changes are merged. To do this, we introduce a `merge` function that unifies another CRDT set into the present one. The `merge` process goes through all the elements in the other set and updates the version counter to the maximum of the current one and the other one. 

```rust
impl CrdtSet {
    // ...

    // merges the other CRDT set into the current set
    fn merge(&mut self, other: &CrdtSet) {
        for (item, other_version) in &other.set { 
            let version = self.set.entry(item.clone()).or_insert(0); 
            *version = std::cmp::max(*version, *other_version); 
        }
    }
}
```


With this basic setup, we have created a simple yet effective `Concurrency Safe CRDT Set` in Rust. This post serves as a primer on implementing CRDTs in Rust and can be expanded by adding more operations, optimizations, and proving formal properties of our CRDT.

Remember, Rust's memory safety paradigm compliments greatly with distributed system's paradigm and allows us to build secure, performant, and concurrent systems. Until next time, Happy Rusting!
