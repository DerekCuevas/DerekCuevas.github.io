## Introduction

In today's world, user interfaces need to be reactive and responsive. They should update in real-time in response to users' actions, server responses, and other events. Reactive programming has evolved to address this need. In this post, you will learn about reactive programming and how to implement it in Elm using RxJS.

## What is Reactive Programming?

Reactive programming is a paradigm that allows you to deal with asynchronous data streams. It is an approach to programming that focuses on how data flows through your system, how it changes over time, and how it impacts other parts of the system. Reactive programming is not a specific language or library; it is a way of thinking about programming.

A reactive program is typically defined as a set of functions that react to data streams. These functions are called observers or subscribers. An observer subscribes to a stream of data and receives events when data is produced. When data changes, the observers react by modifying the user interface or triggering other functions.

## Reactive Programming in Elm

In Elm, you can use RxJS to implement reactive programming. RxJS is a reactive programming library for JavaScript that allows you to work with asynchronous data streams. RxJS is similar to Elm's Signal and Mailbox modules but with many additional features.

RxJS allows you to create observables and subscribe to their events. An observable is a source of events that push data to subscribers. Observables can represent any type of data stream, such as user input, server responses, or timed events. When an observable produces an event, all of its subscribers receive that event and can react to it.

## The Power of Observables and Operators

RxJS provides a wide range of operators that allow you to manipulate and combine observables. Operators perform operations such as filtering, mapping, reducing, and combining data streams. Operators can be used to create complex streams of data from simple ones.

For example, you can use the `map` operator to transform a stream of mouse movements into a stream of coordinates:

```javascript
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
import { map } from 'rxjs/operators';

const mouseMoves = fromEvent(document, 'mousemove');
const coordinates = mouseMoves.pipe(
  map(event => ({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY }))
);
```

In this example, we create an observable from the `mousemove` event using the `fromEvent` function. We then use the `map` operator to transform the event into an object with `x` and `y` properties.

RxJS also provides operators such as `filter`, `throttleTime`, and `debounceTime` that allow you to control the frequency of events emitted by an observable.

## Combining Observables

Using the `combineLatest` operator, you can combine multiple observables into a single stream of events. This is useful when you need to work with data from multiple sources.

For example, you can combine the coordinates stream from the previous example with a stream of server responses:

```javascript
import { fromEvent } from 'rxjs';
import { map, combineLatest } from 'rxjs/operators';

const mouseMoves = fromEvent(document, 'mousemove');
const serverResponse = from(fetch('/api/data'));
const coordinates = mouseMoves.pipe(
  map(event => ({ x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY }))
);

const combined = combineLatest([coordinates, serverResponse]).pipe(
  map(([ coords, data ]) => ({ coords, data }))
);
```

In this example, we combine the `coordinates` and `serverResponse` observables using the `combineLatest` operator. We then map the emitted values into a single object and return that value to subscribers.
