Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web development that ensures websites are usable by all people, including those with disabilities. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has created accessibility guidelines to help developers build websites that are accessible to everyone. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know to make your HTML and CSS code accessible.

## Use Semantic HTML

When building a website, it's essential to use semantic HTML, which improves accessibility by providing structure to content. By using semantic tags, screen readers can understand the purpose of each piece of content on a web page. Standard tags like `header`, `nav`, `main`, and `footer` are crucial in giving a clear structure to a website. Here's an example:

```HTML
<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">About</a></li>
      <li><a href="#">Contact</a></li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>

<main>
  <h1>Welcome to our Website</h1>
  <p>This is the main content of our website.</p>
</main>

<footer>
  <p>Copyright Â© 2022. All rights reserved.</p>
</footer>
```

In the code above, we use `header`, `nav`, `main`, and `footer` tags to define the structure of our website. This way, assistive technologies can recognize and properly interpret the content.

## Use Alt Text for Images

Images are another essential aspect of web development, and it's essential to use alternative text (alt text) to describe images. Screen readers use alt text to describe images to visually-impaired users, so it's crucial to provide accurate descriptions. Here's an example:

```HTML
<img src="img/hero-img.jpg" alt="A woman smiling at a computer">
```

In the code above, we use an `img` tag with the `src` attribute set to the image file path, and the `alt` attribute set to a description of the image.

## Use ARIA Roles

Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) allows developers to create custom semantic tags to help screen readers understand application-specific interactions. When used correctly, ARIA can dramatically improve accessibility. However, improper usage can lead to confusion and make things worse. For example, using a `div` tag as a button is not a good practice, since it does not have the default behavior of a button. A better way to handle this is by using the `button` tag or specifying the appropriate role:

```HTML
<div role="button">Click me</div>
```

In the code above, we use the `role` attribute to specify that the `div` tag should behave like a button.

## Focus Styles

The focus styles are visual indicators that show when a user has selected an interactive element on a web page. Ensuring that focus styles are visible and distinguishable is crucial to users with disabilities who navigate websites using assistive technologies. Here's an example of how to add focus styles to a button:

```CSS
button:focus {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

In the code above, we set the `outline` property on the `:focus` pseudo-class to make the button have a visible focus style.

## Test Your Website for Accessibility

Testing your website for accessibility is essential to ensure that it works for everyone. A variety of tools are available to check website accessibility compliance. The W3C provides a [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool (WAVE)](https://wave.webaim.org/) that checks web pages for accessibility. Another powerful tool is [Google's Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse), which not only evaluates accessibility, but also performance, best practices, and more.

## Conclusion

Accessibility should be a top priority for developers. As web developers, it's our responsibility to ensure that everyone can access the content we provide. Using semantic HTML, alt text for images, ARIA roles, and focus styles can dramatically improve website accessibility. Testing and monitoring the accessibility of websites is critical to ensure that they are working correctly for everyone. With these techniques, you'll be able to create websites that work for everyone.
