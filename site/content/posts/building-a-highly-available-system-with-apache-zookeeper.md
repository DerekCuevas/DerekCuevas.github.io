Apache ZooKeeper is a highly-reliable coordination service that enables distributed systems to work as a single cohesive unit. It provides a simple and efficient way to build distributed systems that function reliably under challenging conditions such as network failures, machine crashes, and other kinds of system failures. In this article, we will explore the key features of Apache ZooKeeper and how to use them to build highly available systems.

### What is Apache ZooKeeper?

Apache ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration, synchronization, and naming data in distributed systems. It is designed to be a high-performance and scalable platform for building distributed systems and applications. Apache ZooKeeper is a critical part of many popular distributed systems, including Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka, and Apache Solr. 

In Apache ZooKeeper, data is stored in a hierarchical namespace similar to a file system. Nodes in the namespace can be created, read, updated, and deleted, and changes to the namespace are propagated to all nodes connected to the ZooKeeper service. 

### Building Highly-Available Systems with ZooKeeper

One of the key features of Apache ZooKeeper is its ability to provide a highly available service. This means that even if some of the ZooKeeper nodes fail, the service remains available and can continue to process requests. A highly available service is essential for distributed systems that need to operate seamlessly without any disruption.

There are several ways to configure Apache ZooKeeper to provide high availability. One approach is to run multiple ZooKeeper nodes in a cluster, with each node hosting a copy of the configuration data. The nodes communicate with each other and synchronize their data so that they have a consistent view of the system's state.

Here is an example of how to configure an Apache ZooKeeper ensemble with three nodes:

```bash
server.1=zookeeper1:2888:3888
server.2=zookeeper2:2888:3888
server.3=zookeeper3:2888:3888
```

In this example, the configuration data is spread across three nodes: `zookeeper1`, `zookeeper2`, and `zookeeper3`. Each node is assigned a unique identifier (`1`,`2`, and `3`) and a client port (`2888`) and a leader-election port (`3888`).

When starting the ZooKeeper ensemble, it is critical to ensure that a majority of nodes are available and running in order for the service to be operational. For example, if there are three nodes in the cluster, the service will be operational as long as two or more nodes are running.

### Synchronization in ZooKeeper

In a distributed system, it is essential to maintain consistency between nodes to ensure that the system functions reliably. Apache ZooKeeper provides a simple and efficient way to achieve synchronization between nodes by using its atomic update feature. 

Atomic update is an operation that guarantees that a group of related changes is applied to the ZooKeeper namespace atomically. This means that either all changes are applied or none of them are applied, ensuring that the system remains consistent. 

Here is an example of how to update a node atomically in ZooKeeper:

```python
zookeeper.setData("/my/node", "new data".getBytes(), -1);
```

In this example, the `setData()` method updates the `/my/node` node with the data `new data`. The `-1` parameter specifies that the update should happen atomically.

### Conclusion

Apache ZooKeeper is a powerful tool for building distributed systems that require coordination and synchronization between nodes. It provides a highly available service that can help ensure that systems remain operational even under challenging conditions. By using ZooKeeper's atomic update feature, developers can achieve consistency between nodes, enabling the system to function reliably. Overall, Apache ZooKeeper is an essential tool for building highly available distributed systems.
