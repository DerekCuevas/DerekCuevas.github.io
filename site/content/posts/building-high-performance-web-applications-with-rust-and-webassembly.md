WebAssembly (WASM) has become increasingly popular in recent years as a compile target for high-performance applications that can run in the browser. With cross-platform support and the ability to run languages such as Rust at near-native speeds within the browser, WASM has become an attractive option for building high-performance web applications. In this post, we will explore the benefits of using Rust and WebAssembly to build high-performance web applications and provide a step-by-step guide for building a sample application.

## Introduction

WebAssembly (WASM) is a low-level assembly language that provides a virtual machine for the web. It is designed to be a portable target for the compilation of high-level languages such as Rust, C, and C++. Rust is a systems programming language that provides control over low-level system resources while maintaining high-level abstractions. Its performance and safety features make it an excellent choice for building high-demand web applications. In this post, we'll explore the benefits of using Rust with WebAssembly for building web applications and walk through an example of building a sample application.

## Benefits of Using Rust with WebAssembly

There are several benefits of using Rust with WebAssembly for building web applications:

### 1. Performance

Rust's performance is comparable to C and C++, making it an excellent choice for building high-performance web applications. WebAssembly provides a virtual machine that can execute applications at near-native speeds. Additionally, WASM modules are small and efficient, meaning that they can be loaded quickly, improving the overall performance of the application.

### 2. Safety

Rust provides several safety features that make it ideal for building web applications that handle sensitive data. Rust's ownership system ensures that memory is handled safely and prevents common programming errors such as null pointer dereference and buffer overflows. Additionally, the WASM sandboxing and memory management model provides an additional layer of safety when executing Rust code in the browser.

### 3. Cross-Platform Support

WebAssembly is a cross-platform technology that can run on any platform that supports modern web browsers. This ensures that WASM applications can run on desktop and mobile devices without requiring separate builds for each platform.

## Building a High-Performance Web Application with Rust and WebAssembly

Let's build a simple web application using Rust and WebAssembly. We will use the wasm-pack toolchain to create a new Rust project that can be compiled to WebAssembly. This project will include a Rust library and a JavaScript file that interacts with the DOM.

### Setting up the Project

First, let's install the `wasm-pack` tool using `cargo`.

```console
cargo install wasm-pack
```

Now, let's create a new Rust project using the *wasm-pack-npm* template.

```console
wasm-pack new my-web-app --template npm
```

This will create a new Rust project named `my-web-app` with the `npm` template, which includes a `Cargo.toml` file, `src/lib.rs`, and `js` folder containing a `wasm.js` file and `index.js`. These files will be used to build the WebAssembly module and interact with the DOM.

### Writing the Rust Code

Now, let's add some Rust code to our project. In this example, we will create a `hello` function that returns a greeting.

```rust
// src/lib.rs
use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn hello(name: &str) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {}!", name)
}
```

The `hello` function uses the `wasm_bindgen` macro, which generates the necessary JavaScript bindings for the WebAssembly module. The function takes a string parameter and returns a formatted string greeting the name passed as the parameter.

### Building and Compiling the WebAssembly Module

Now, let's build and compile the WebAssembly module using the `wasm-pack` toolchain.

```console
wasm-pack build --target web
```

This will create a `pkg` directory containing the compiled WebAssembly module and the generated JavaScript bindings. We can now import these bindings in our `index.js` file to interact with the DOM.

### Interacting with the DOM

In our `index.js` file, we create a `hello` function that takes a name parameter and displays the greeting using the `console.log` method.

```javascript
// js/index.js

import wasm from "../pkg/my_web_app.js";

async function run() {
    const { hello } = await wasm();
    console.log(hello("World"));
}
run();
```

In this example, we use the `await` keyword to wait for the WebAssembly module to load before calling the `hello` function. We then call the `hello` function with the parameter `World` and display the result in the console.

### Serving the Application

We can now serve our application using a web server such as `webpack-dev-server`.

```console
npm install webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server
```

Now, let's add a script to our `package.json` file to run the `webpack-dev-server`.

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack serve --mode development",
},
```

Finally, let's start the server by running the following command:

```console
npm run start
```

This will start the server and serve the application on `http://localhost:8080`.

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored the benefits of using Rust with WebAssembly for building high-performance web applications. We walked through an example of building a simple web application using Rust and WebAssembly that interacted with the DOM. Rust's performance and safety features make it an excellent choice for building web applications that handle sensitive data. Additionally, WASM's cross-platform support ensures that applications can run on any platform that supports modern web browsers.
