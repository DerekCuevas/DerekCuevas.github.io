### Introduction

In recent years, Rust has been gaining increasing momentum in various sectors of the tech industry, especially in systems programming, due to its performance, reliability, and focus on zero-cost abstractions. One area where Rust has been making a significant impact is in web development, courtesy of web frameworks like `Actix`. Actix is a powerful, pragmatic, and extremely fast web framework for Rust, offering a clean and intuitive API to build scalable and maintainable web applications.

### Why choose Actix?

Actix excels in areas such as performance and features robustness. It is built on `Actix Net`, a powerful, low-level networking abstraction built around the `Actor` model, which allows for excellent performance and flexibility. Furthermore, Actix is built with safety in mind, leveraging Rustâ€™s strong typing and ownership model.

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpServer, Responder};

async fn index() -> impl Responder {
    "Hello World!"
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .route("/", web::get().to(index))
    })
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
    .run()
    .await
}
```
Above is a simple example of how to create a basic HTTP server using Actix.

### Working with Actix

The Actix web framework is centered around a few core components: Handlers, Routers, and Applications.

**Handlers**: In Actix, request handlers are async functions that accept zero or more parameters that implement the `FromRequest` trait and return a type implementing `Responder`.

```rust
async fn index(info: web::Path<(String,)>) -> String {
    let (name,) = info.into_inner();
    format!("Welcome, {}!", name)
}
```
In this simplified example, the handler takes a single `Path` parameter and returns a `String`.

**Routing**: Actix provides a powerful and flexible system for routing requests to handlers, allowing complex routing configurations to be easily built up in an intuitive manner.

```rust
App::new()
    .service(web::resource("/users/{name}").route(web::get().to(index)))
```
The router here matches on the pattern "/users/{name}" and sends `GET` requests to the `index` handler.

**Application**: The entry point into an Actix web service is an `App` instance. This can be used to configure routes, manage shared application state, and set up middleware.

```rust
App::new()
    .service(
        web::resource("/users/{username}").route(web::get().to(index)))
```
In this case, the `App` is setting up a single route which will hit the `index` handler whenever a user hits the "/users/{username}" endpoint with a `GET` request.

### Conclusion

Rust, coupled with Actix, is a strong option when it comes to building a web service. Actix leverages Rust's strengths such as speed and memory safety, providing an easy-to-use, high-level API upon a high performance, low-level networking stack. With the ability to handle millions of connections in a single thread, Actix proves to be highly competitive compared to its counterparts in various languages. By adapting Actix to your web service development, you're not only choosing a framework, but also stepping into a whole new dimension of building scalable and maintainable applications.
