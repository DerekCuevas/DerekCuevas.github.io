Clojure is a modern programming language that is known for its high level of conciseness and expressiveness. One of the major features that sets it apart from other programming languages is its powerful system of persistent data structures. In this post, we will dive into the world of Clojure's persistent data structures, exploring the strengths and weaknesses of these unique collections.

## What are Persistent Data Structures?

In traditional data structures found in many other programming languages, mutations to the structure require copying the entire data structure. This can be a computationally expensive operation, especially for larger data sets. Persistent data structures are designed to mitigate this cost by sharing memory between different versions of the data structure.

In Clojure, all basic data structures such as lists, vectors, maps, and sets, are implemented as persistent data structures. This means that even when you modify a data structure, the original version remains unaltered.

## Advantages of Persistent Data Structures

### Immutability

Persistent data structures are immutable, which means that once they are created, their contents cannot be modified in place. Instead, any operation that changes the structure of the data structure creates a new version (or "copy") of the data structure. This ensures that the original version of the data is always available, and makes concurrent programming easier and safer.

```clojure
(def my-vector [1 2 3])
; => [1 2 3]

(conj my-vector 4)
; => [1 2 3 4]

my-vector
; => [1 2 3]
```

In the example above, we start with a defined vector, `my-vector`. When we add an element to the vector with the `conj` function, we get a new vector containing the original elements plus the newly added element. However, the original `my-vector` is still unchanged.

### Efficient Copy-On-Write

Persistent data structures do not always require full copying; they can share memory between versions to reduce the cost of read-only operations. When a modification is made to a persistent data structure, only the nodes that are "affected" by the change are copied. This makes read-only operations very efficient by allowing different versions of the data structure to share the same memory, even if they differ slightly.

```clojure
(def my-vector [1 2 3])
; => [1 2 3]

(def my-new-vector (conj my-vector 4))
; => [1 2 3 4]

(= my-vector my-new-vector)
; => false
```

The `conj` function returns a new vector that includes the new element, but it shares memory with the original vector where possible. In the example above, calling `(= my-vector my-new-vector)` will return `false` because the two vectors are distinct objects in memory, but much of the data contained within them actually occupies the same memory.

### Versioning

Since each modification of a persistent data structure creates a new version of the data structure, it is possible to retain a full history of all previous versions. This can be useful when working with data that needs to be audited or when reproducing a bug.

```clojure
(def my-vector [1 2 3]) ; version 1
(def my-new-vector (conj my-vector 4)) ; version 2
(def my-newer-vector (conj my-new-vector 5)) ; version 3
```

In this example, we are creating three different persistent vectors with each operation building on the previous one. The original version of `my-vector` contains `[1 2 3]`, the second version contains `[1 2 3 4]`, and the third version contains `[1 2 3 4 5]`. All three versions of the data can be retained and used as needed.

## Disadvantages of Persistent Data Structures

### Increased Memory Usage

Persistent data structures use more memory than their non-persistent counterparts. This is due to the fact that when modifications are made to the data structure, a new version, or copy, of the entire data structure is created. The old version remains in memory, which can lead to an increased memory footprint.

### Slower Write Operations

One of the reasons why persistent data structures are slower than mutable data structures is because there is a cost associated with creating new versions of the data. This can make write operations, such as adding or deleting elements, slower than in a mutable data structure.

## Conclusion

Clojure's persistent data structures are an amazing tool for simplifying concurrent programming and preserving a history of previous states. By focusing on mutation as a new version of an object, parts of the structure can be efficiently shared between versions. However, it is important to remember that persistent data structures have a unique set of trade-offs (such as greater memory usage), and should be used judiciously to take full advantage of their benefits.
