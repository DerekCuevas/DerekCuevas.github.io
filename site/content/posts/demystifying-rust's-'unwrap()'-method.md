Rust is known for its strong type system and efficient memory management. Error handling is also considered to be a key feature of Rust, with the language providing a variety of error handling mechanisms that are designed to catch errors at compile time. One such mechanism is the Result type, which has been a topic of much discussion among Rust programmers. However, Rustomers frequently employ the simpler, yet contentious, 'unwrap()' method. 

In this article, we will dive deep into the 'unwrap()' Rust method, its usage and the controversy that surrounds it, and when it’s okay to use it.

## What is 'unwrap()' in Rust?
 
The 'unwrap()' method is a built-in Rust method that returns the inner value of an Option type or a Result type. It is one of the most frequently used Rust methods and will often compile code faster than other error handling mechanisms. 

Here is a simple code example that illustrates how 'unwrap()' can be used with an 'Option' type:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: Option<i32> = Some(5);
    let y = x.unwrap();
    println!("{}", y);
}
```

The program declares an 'Option<i32>' type and assigns it a value of 'Some(5)'. It then unwraps the value out of the 'Option' type and prints it to the console. In this case, the output would be '5'. 

## When to Use 'unwrap()'

While 'unwrap()' is a convenient and commonly used Rust method, it can be a source of contention within the Rust community, with many programmers discouraging its usage in professional code. The reason for this is due to its risk of causing runtime errors if the value being unwrapped is actually 'None'. 

Using 'unwrap()' can shorten code, but can also create unexpected errors within the code runtime, as illustrated in the following example:

```rust
fn get_user_name() -> String {
    std::env::var("USER").unwrap()
}
```

This function intends to get the name of the current user on the machine. However, if the 'USER' environment variable is not set on the machine, the 'unwrap()' method will panic causing the program to abort. 

Therefore, when deciding to use 'unwrap()', it’s essential to evaluate a particular 'use case' and consider the possible consequences of runtime errors. Generally, 'unwrap()' should be used only if the behavior of the program can be predictable when the value being unwrapped is a 'Some' variant or when you can guarantee the result won’t be 'None'. 

## Alternatives to 'unwrap()'

'Rust' offers alternatives to the 'unwrap()' method, which includes the 'expect()' method, the '? operator' and the 'match' statement. While these are longer and protract error handling, they better handle runtime errors and refine the program’s behavior.

Here is the above example rewritten using a 'match' statement:

```rust
fn get_user_name() -> String {
    match std::env::var("USER") {
        Ok(val) => val,
        Err(_e) => "could not get user name".to_string(),
    }
}
```
In this function, a 'match' statement deconstructs the ‘Result’ type returned from 'std::env::var' method and returns the 'val' if 'Ok(val)' and a string error message otherwise. 

## Conclusion

'unwrap()' is a powerful method in Rust that offers a convenient way of obtaining the intended value of an 'Option' or 'Result' type but its wrong use may result in runtime errors that program can not recover from. In production code, it is not recommended to use 'unwrap()' unless the result is guaranteed to be 'Some' or when the behavior can reliably handle 'None'. It is always best to choose a specific error handling mechanism to achieve the desired program behavior. 

By understanding when to use and the consequences of wrong usage, we hope you feel confident in applying this method in Rust and can prevent any unexpected run time errors.
