# Mastering the Composite Design Pattern in C#

The Composite Design Pattern is a structural pattern that allows the creation of object hierarchies where each object in the hierarchy is either a leaf node (i.e., has no children) or a composite node (i.e., has one or more children). The pattern defines a uniform way to interact with both types of objects. This pattern is useful in situations where a client needs to interact with a group of objects in the same way that it interacts with an individual object.

In this post, we will explore the Composite Design Pattern in C# and demonstrate how it can be used to build complex object hierarchies.

## The Structure of the Composite Design Pattern

The Composite Design Pattern consists of the following components:

- Component – defines the operations that are common to both composite and leaf nodes.
- Leaf – represents a single object in the hierarchy. It has no children, and its implementation of the Component interface does not include add or remove operations.
- Composite – represents a group of objects in the hierarchy. It has one or more children, and its implementation of the Component interface includes add, remove, and getChild operations.

## Implementing the Composite Design Pattern in C#

Let's say we want to build a file system hierarchy, where directories can contain subdirectories and files. We can use the Composite Design Pattern to represent this hierarchy.

First, we define the Component interface:

```csharp
public interface IDirectoryComponent
{
    void Add(IDirectoryComponent component);
    void Remove(IDirectoryComponent component);
    string GetName();
    void Print(int depth);
}
```

This interface defines the operations that are common to both composite and leaf nodes. The `Add()` and `Remove()` methods are used to add and remove children, the `GetName()` method returns the name of the node, and `Print()` is used to print the node's name and the names of its children.

Next, we define the File class to represent a leaf node:

```csharp
public class File : IDirectoryComponent
{
    private readonly string _name;

    public File(string name)
    {
        _name = name;
    }

    public void Add(IDirectoryComponent component)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Cannot add to a file.");
    }

    public void Remove(IDirectoryComponent component)
    {
        throw new InvalidOperationException("Cannot remove from a file.");
    }

    public string GetName()
    {
        return _name;
    }

    public void Print(int depth)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(new string('-', depth) + _name);
    }
}
```

A File object cannot have children, so its `Add()` and `Remove()` methods throw `InvalidOperationException`. The `GetName()` method returns the name of the file, and the `Print()` method prints the name of the file with an appropriate number of dashes to indicate its depth in the hierarchy.

Finally, we define the Directory class to represent a composite node:

```csharp
public class Directory : IDirectoryComponent
{
    private readonly List<IDirectoryComponent> _components = new List<IDirectoryComponent>();
    private readonly string _name;

    public Directory(string name)
    {
        _name = name;
    }

    public void Add(IDirectoryComponent component)
    {
        _components.Add(component);
    }

    public void Remove(IDirectoryComponent component)
    {
        _components.Remove(component);
    }

    public string GetName()
    {
        return _name;
    }

    public void Print(int depth)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(new string('-', depth) + _name);
        foreach (var component in _components)
        {
            component.Print(depth + 2);
        }
    }
}
```

The Directory class has a collection of children (_components) and implements the `Add()`, `Remove()`, and `GetName()` methods accordingly. In the case of `Print()`, it first prints the name of the directory and then calls `Print()` on each child with an incremented depth.

## Testing the Composite Design Pattern in C#

Let's test our implementation of the Composite Design Pattern by creating a file system hierarchy and then printing its contents:

```csharp
public static void Main()
{
    var file1 = new File("file1.txt");
    var file2 = new File("file2.txt");
    var file3 = new File("file3.txt");

    var subDirectory1 = new Directory("Subdirectory 1");
    var subDirectory2 = new Directory("Subdirectory 2");

    subDirectory1.Add(file1);
    subDirectory1.Add(file2);

    subDirectory2.Add(file3);
    subDirectory2.Add(new File("file4.txt"));
    subDirectory2.Add(new File("file5.txt"));

    var rootDirectory = new Directory("Root");
    rootDirectory.Add(subDirectory1);
    rootDirectory.Add(subDirectory2);
    rootDirectory.Add(new File("file6.txt"));

    rootDirectory.Print(0);
}
```

This will output the following file system hierarchy:

```
Root
--Subdirectory 1
----file1.txt
----file2.txt
--Subdirectory 2
----file3.txt
----file4.txt
----file5.txt
--file6.txt
```

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored the Composite Design Pattern in C# and demonstrated how it can be used to build complex object hierarchies. By separating the common operations between component and leaf nodes into the Component interface, we can write code that interacts with either type of node in a uniform way. The Composite Design Pattern is useful in situations where a client needs to interact with a group of objects in the same way that it interacts with an individual object.
