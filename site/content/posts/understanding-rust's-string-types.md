Rust is known for its performance and memory safety. One key area where this applies is strings, which are used heavily in many programs. Understanding Rust's string types is fundamental to writing efficient and effective Rust code. In this post, we'll take a deep dive into Rust's various string types, how to use them, and how they impact performance.

## Introduction

Rust has two main string types: `String` and `&str`. `String` is an owned, growable heap-allocated UTF-8 encoded string, while `&str` is a slice of a UTF-8 encoded string. The former is generally used when ownership of a string is necessary, while the latter is used when a string is only needed temporarily. Let's investigate both types in more detail.

## The `String` Type

`String` is Rust's main string type. It is a growable, heap-allocated, UTF-8 encoded string. A `String` is created with the `String::new()` function or by converting a string literal with the `String::from()` method:

```rust
let s1 = String::new();

let s2 = String::from("hello");
```

`String`'s content can be modified by using methods such as `push_str()`, `push()`, and `append()`:

```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
s.push_str(", world!"); // appends a string slice
println!("{}", s); // "hello, world!"

let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = String::from(", world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
// s3 is now "hello, world!"
```

Contrary to popular belief, creating and appending to a `String` is not expensive in terms of execution time. When appending to a `String`, Rust simply allocates more memory as needed to accommodate the additional data. This is called "growing the buffer" and is typically very fast. 

```rust
let mut s = String::new();

for i in 0..10_000 {
    s += &i.to_string();
}
```

In the above example, Rust will allocate the required memory in "chunks", so `s` will only be reallocated a few times, if at all. 

## The `&str` Type

`&str` is Rust's reference to a string slice. A string slice is a reference to a portion of a UTF-8 encoded string. String literals are also considered string slices. A string slice has a fixed size, and cannot be resized:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
let slice = &s[0..2];
println!("{}", slice); // "he"
```

Here, `slice` is a reference to the first two bytes of `s`. String slices are often passed to functions in order to avoid the overhead of moving ownership, and can be used for pattern matching and more.

```rust
fn does_something(slice: &str) {
    // do something with the slice
}

let s = String::from("hello, world!");
does_something(&s[0..5]); // pass a string slice as a parameter
```

In general, `&str` is used instead of `String` when you only need a string temporarily, or when a function requires a string slice as an argument.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Rust's `String` and `&str` types are an essential part of the language. With their UTF-8 encoding and heap-allocated format, they provide not only safety from memory-related bugs, but also impressive performance. Understanding the difference between these two types and when to use each is critical to writing high-quality Rust code.
