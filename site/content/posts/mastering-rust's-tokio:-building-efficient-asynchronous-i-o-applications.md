## Introduction

As the amount of data processed by applications continues to rise, it becomes increasingly necessary to make effective use of asynchronous programming techniques to handle simultaneous IO-bound tasks. When dealing with IO-bound tasks, blocking the thread until the operation completes is an inefficient use of resources. In an effort to address this issue, Rust introduces the `Tokio` runtime, a powerful tool for asynchronous programming. In this article, we'll take a deep dive into the functionality and patterns of this library to provide you with the knowledge to build your own efficient asynchronous I/O applications in Rust.

## Understanding Tokio

`Tokio` is a Rust framework for developing applications which perform asynchronous I/O — an essential requirement in lightweight, scalable and high-performance network programming. It provides asynchronous, event-driven platforms for building non-blocking applications using the Rust programming language.

```rust
[derekcuevas.tokio]
version = "1.0"
features = ["full"]
```

## The async & await Keywords

Rust has two keywords `async` and `await`, which make handling asynchronous code much more straightforward. Any function annotated with `async` will return a future—an object which represents a value that may not have been computed yet. We can pause the execution of an `async` function using `.await` until the future is resolved.

```rust
async fn async_function() {
    some_future.await;
}
```

## Tokio::spawn

In `Tokio`, you can use the `tokio::spawn` function to execute an asynchronous operation in the background. The operation passed must be a future. This function is a non-blocking operation—it immediately returns a `JoinHandle<OutputOfYourFuture>`.

```rust
async fn long_running_operation() {
    // Simulating long running operation
    tokio::time::sleep(tokio::time::Duration::from_secs(5)).await
}

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let join_handle = tokio::spawn(long_running_operation());
    // You can execute other operations here
    join_handle.await;
}
```
## Creating Tcp Listener Using Tokio

`Tokio` also provides asynchronous versions of standard library types such as `TcpListener` and `TcpStream`. Here's an example of an echo server using Tokio's asynchronous `TcpListener`:

```rust
use tokio::io::{AsyncReadExt, AsyncWriteExt};
use tokio::net::TcpListener;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;

    loop {
        let (mut socket, _) = listener.accept().await?;
        tokio::spawn(async move {
            let mut buf = vec![0; 1024];

            // In a loop, read data from the socket and write the data back.
            loop {
                let n = match socket.read(&mut buf).await {
                    // socket closed
                    Ok(n) if n == 0 => return,
                    Ok(n) => n,
                    Err(e) => {
                        println!("failed to read from socket; err = {:?}", e);
                        return;
                    }
                };

                // Write the data back
                if let Err(e) = socket.write_all(&buf[0..n]).await {
                    println!("failed to write to socket; err = {:?}", e);
                    return;
                }
            }
        });
    }
}
```

In the above example, the server will continue to read from an accepted connection and write back to the it until the client closes the connection.

## Conclusion

In this article we've explored `Tokio`, the powerful, efficient Rust framework for asynchronous programming. We've discussed the basic functionality of the library, and how to use it to create asynchronous code in Rust. Patterns using `Tokio` can help create efficient asynchronous I/O applications, making it a valuable tool when dealing with IO-bound tasks in Rust.
