Array partitions are a powerful tool to improve performance in Python applications. They allow you to divide big arrays into smaller pieces, operating on each piece independently. This approach can be used in a range of applications, from data processing to numerical simulations and machine learning.

In this post, we'll take a deep dive into the array partitioning technique, see how it can be used to optimize performance, and learn how to implement array partitioning in Python.

## What are Array Partitions?

Array partitioning is the process of dividing an array into smaller sub-arrays, or partitions to better utilize available computational resources. This approach is especially useful when working with large data sets that can occupy significant portions of the memory, as processing only a portion at a time can prevent the operating system from having to use virtual memory to compensate for memory limitations.

Array partitioning can be applied to both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional arrays. For example, you might partition a one-dimensional array into several smaller chunks, or partition a two-dimensional array along either the row or column axis, or both.

Once the partitions are created, we can apply multi-core CPU parallelism to operate on each partition independently, which significantly speeds up computation time.

## How to Implement Array Partitioning in Python

In Python, there are several ways to implement array partitioning. One of the simplest methods is to use the `numpy.array_split()` method to partition a numpy array into equally sized partitions. 

```python
import numpy as np

# create 1D array
arr = np.arange(10)

print("Original array: \n", arr)

# partition array into chunks of size 3
partitions = np.array_split(arr, 3)

# print partitions
for i, p in enumerate(partitions):
    print(f"Partition {i}: {p}")
```

Output:
```
Original array:
 [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9]
Partition 0: [0 1 2 3]
Partition 1: [4 5 6]
Partition 2: [7 8 9]
```

In this example, we created a one-dimensional numpy array and used the `numpy.array_split()` method to partition the array into 3 partitions. We then looped through each partition and printed the partition contents.

We can also partition multi-dimensional arrays in a similar way. For example, to partition a 2D-array column-wise, we can use the `numpy.hsplit()` method:

```python
# create 2D array
arr_2d = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

# partition array along the column axis
partitions = np.hsplit(arr_2d, 3)

# print partitions
for i, p in enumerate(partitions):
    print(f"Partition {i}: \n {p}")
```

Output:
```
Partition 0:
 [[1]
 [4]
 [7]]
Partition 1:
 [[2]
 [5]
 [8]]
Partition 2:
 [[3]
 [6]
 [9]]
```

In this example, we partitioned a two-dimensional array along the column axis by using the `numpy.hsplit()` method. We then printed each partition separately.

## How to Use Array Partitions to Improve Performance

Now that we know how to partition arrays in Python, let's see how we can use partitioning to improve our code's performance.

Assuming we have a time-consuming computation, we can partition our data and use multi-core parallelism to process each part independently. In this way, we can distribute computation over several cores and reduce total computation time. 

Here's an example of how we can use array partitioning to calculate the sum of a 2D numpy array:

```python
import time

# create a large 2D array
large_arr = np.random.randn(10_000, 10_000)

# split the array in half
partitions = np.split(large_arr, 2)

# sum each partition in parallel
sums = []
for p in partitions:
    start = time.time()
    result = np.sum(p)
    sums.append(result)
    end = time.time()
    print(f"Partition processed in {end - start:.5f} seconds")

# combine results
result = np.sum(sums)
```

In this example, we created a large two-dimensional numpy array, and partitioned it into two sub-arrays. We then used a `for` loop to sequentially sum each partition. Using multi-core CPU parallelism could be an option via any multiprocessing, concurrent.futures or dask. 

By utilizing partitioning and parallelism, the total sum can be computed much faster than when the entire array is processed in one go.

## Conclusion

Array partitioning is a powerful performance optimization technique for any Python application that deals with large arrays or datasets. With array partitioning, we can divide up a larger dataset into smaller partitions, use each partition in parallel, and reduce computation time.
