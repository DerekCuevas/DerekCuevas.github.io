WebAssembly (WASM) is a binary instruction format which is designed as a portable target for the compilation of high-level programming languages like C, C++, Rust, and others. The web browser can execute WebAssembly code directly, thus it is perfect for web applications where security is a priority. 

WebAssembly Text Format is a text representation of the binary format. It is a human-readable and writable file format that describes the binary module. In this post, we will cover everything about the WebAssembly Text Format, its syntax, structure, and how to compile and run it in Rust. 

## WebAssembly Text Format

WebAssembly binary format is designed to be a low-level representation of the code that is executed on the web browser. The text format, on the other hand, is a higher-level representation of the same code. It is similar to assembly language code which can be read by humans but not necessarily written by hand. 

### Syntax

WebAssembly Text Format is a linear text file format. It consists of a series of instructions and comments. Instructions are denoted by their opcode and operands and written in a specific syntax. Each instruction has a concise notation and an extended notation. 

The concise notation consists of an opcode followed by its arguments, separated by whitespace. The extended notation consists of an opcode followed by its arguments which may be in a nested structure, enclosed in parentheses. 

Here's an example of the concise notation: 

```
i32.add
```

And, here's an example of the extended notation: 

```
(module
  (func $add (param i32 i32) (result i32)
    get_local 0
    get_local 1
    i32.add
  )
)
```

### Structure

WebAssembly Text Format is organized into several sections. Each section starts with a keyword followed by its contents. The following is the list of sections that a WebAssembly module can contain:

- `module`: This section contains the definition of the module.
- `type`: This section defines the function signature used by the module.
- `import`: This section defines the functions that are imported from the host environment.
- `function`: This section defines the functions that are defined in the module.
- `table`: This section defines one or more tables that the module uses.
- `memory`: This section defines the linear memory used by the module.
- `global`: This section defines the global variables used by the module.
- `export`: This section specifies the functions that are exported from the module.
- `start`: This section specifies the function that is executed when the module is loaded.
- `element`: This section defines the initial contents of a table.
- `data`: This section defines the initial contents of linear memory.

Here's an example of a WebAssembly module with all the sections: 

```
(module
  (type (func (param i32 i32) (result i32)))
  (import "env" "add" (func $add (param i32 i32) (result i32)))
  (memory 1)
  (global $result i32 (i32.const 0))
  (export "result" (global $result))
  (export "add" (func $add))
  (start func $init)
  (func $init (param i32) (result i32)
    (call $add (get_local 0) (i32.const 1))
  )
  (data (i32.const 0) "Hello World!")
)
```

### Compiling and Running WebAssembly Text Format in Rust

WebAssembly Text Format files can be compiled into a WebAssembly binary using the `wat2wasm` tool. 

```bash
$ wat2wasm mymodule.wat -o mymodule.wasm
```

In Rust, the `wasm-bindgen` and `wasm-pack` tools can be used to create, build and publish Rust-generated WebAssembly files. 

```rust
extern crate wasm_bindgen;

use wasm_bindgen::prelude::*;

#[wasm_bindgen]
pub fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    a + b
}
```

After writing the Rust code and compiling it, we need to create the JavaScript glue code to communicate between JavaScript and Rust. 

```bash
$ wasm-pack build --target web
```

An example of the HTML and JavaScript code that use this Rust-generated WebAssembly code would be: 

```html
<html>
    <head>
        <title>WebAssembly Test</title>
        <script src="pkg/wasm_test.js"></script>
        <script>
            const wasm = require('./pkg/wasm_test.js');
            console.log(wasm.add(2, 3));
        </script>
    </head>
    <body>
    </body>
</html>
```

## Conclusion

In this post, we have covered all aspects of WebAssembly Text Format, its syntax, structure, and how to compile and run it using Rust. WebAssembly Text Format is a human-readable file format designed to represent the binary format of WebAssembly modules. It is an essential tool for debugging, testing, and learning WebAssembly.
