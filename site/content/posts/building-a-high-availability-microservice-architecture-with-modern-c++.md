Introduction:
Distributed systems have become the norm in modern web development. A microservice architecture is one way to build such a system, allowing us to isolate components and scale more easily. Building a microservice is often done with higher-level languages, but C++ has become a popular choice for high-performance at scale. In this post, we will take a deeper look into designing and deploying a high-availability, distributed C++ microservice architecture.

Section 1: Choosing a communication protocol
A microservice architecture requires communication between many separate services. In order to achieve a high-availability system, a message-oriented middleware solution can be implemented to buffer messages and allow the services to communicate asynchronously. Apache Kafka is often used as a solution, but ZeroMQ is a popular lightweight alternative that can handle large numbers of messages and provides multiple patterns of communication. Let's see how a ZeroMQ PUB-SUB communication model can be used to build a robust microservice system. 

```
// ZeroMQ PUB building

zmq::context_t context{1};
zmq::socket_t publisher{context, zmq::socket_type::pub};
publisher.bind("tcp://*:5556");

// Publish a message
while (true) {
    const std::string json_message = create_message();
    zmq::message_t zmq_message{json_message.length()};
    memcpy(zmq_message.data(), json_message.c_str(), json_message.length());
    publisher.send(zmq_message); 
}
```

```
// ZeroMQ SUB building

zmq::context_t context{1};
zmq::socket_t subscriber{context, zmq::socket_type::sub};
subscriber.connect("tcp://localhost:5556");
subscriber.setsockopt(ZMQ_SUBSCRIBE, "", 0);

// Wait for a message
while (true) {
    zmq::message_t zmq_message{};
    subscriber.recv(&zmq_message);
    const std::string json_message = std::string(static_cast<char*>(zmq_message.data()), zmq_message.size());
    process_message(json_message);
}
```

Section 2: Integrating a load balancer
Once the communication protocol is selected, we can focus on scalability and availability. A common pattern used in a microservice architecture is the use of a load balancer, distributing load evenly across multiple services to avoid overwhelming any one particular instance. Nginx is a popular open source web server and reverse proxy that can be used as a load balancer. Let's see how Nginx can be configured to balance external requests to multiple C++ microservices.

```
http {
  upstream backend {
    least_conn;

    server backend1.example.com;
    server backend2.example.com;
    server backend3.example.com;
  }

  server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com;

    location / {
      proxy_pass http://backend;
    }
  }
}
```

Section 3: Implementing a backup and recovery system
In order to maintain high availability, it's important to also consider failover and recovery. C++ microservices can be designed with automatic service recovery and backup redundancy plans. In order to design a system like this, individual microservices must be identified with their own service-level agreements and failure modes. Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) or Google Cloud Storage are popular choices for off-site backup storage. Let's see how a backup system can be implemented using S3.

```
// S3 backup
Aws::S3::S3Client client;

Aws::S3::Model::PutObjectRequest put_object_request;
put_object_request.WithBucket("my-bucket")
                   .WithKey("my-key")
                   .WithBody(data_stream);

const Aws::S3::Model::PutObjectOutcome put_object_outcome = client.PutObject(put_object_request);

if (put_object_outcome.IsSuccess()) {
    std::cout << "Object successfully uploaded to S3" << std::endl;
} else {
    std::cout << "Error uploading object to S3: " << put_object_outcome.GetError().GetMessage() << std::endl;
}
```

Section 4: Conclusion
Building a high-availability C++ microservice architecture requires careful consideration of communication protocol, load balancing, and redundancy. By utilizing technologies like ZeroMQ, Nginx, and AWS S3, we can construct a highly-available microservice system that can scale to meet the demands of a modern distributed application.

Combining reliability and performance, C++ is a great option for building a high-performing microservice architecture. The implementation of microservices must be done carefully and often take a lot of planning.
