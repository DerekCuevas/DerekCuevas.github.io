WebSockets are a powerful and widely used technology for building web-based real-time applications. Rust is a high-performance language that provides the developer with a powerful set of tools for building high-performance systems. In this post, we will explore how to use Rust and WebSockets to build real-time, high-performance applications.

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Rust programming language
- Familiarity with WebSockets protocol

### Setting up the Environment

Before we start building the application, we need to set up the environment. First, we need to create a new Rust project. We can do this by running the following commands in the terminal:

```shell
$ cargo new rust-ws-app
$ cd rust-ws-app
```

Next, we will add the `tokio` library to our `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.10", features = ["full"] }
```

### Implementing the Server

To implement the server, we must first create the event loop and the WebSocket server. We will be using the `tokio` library to create the event loop. We can initialize the event loop by creating a new variable of type `tokio::runtime::Runtime`.

```rust
use tokio::runtime::Runtime;

fn main() {
    let rt = match Runtime::new() {
        Ok(rt) => rt,
        Err(e) => {
            eprintln!("Failed to create the event loop: {}", e);
            return;
        }
    };
}
```

We then need to create the server and bind it to an address. This will allow the WebSocket to receive incoming connections.

```rust
// Setup the server
let server = match WebSocket::new()
    .bind("127.0.0.1:8000", &rt)
    .await
{
    Ok(server) => server,
    Err(e) => {
        eprintln!("Failed to bind the server to the address: {}", e);
        return;
    }
};
```

Once we have the server setup, we can start accepting incoming connections:

```rust
// Start the server
server.listen().await;
```

To handle incoming messages, we must implement the `WebSocketListener` trait. The `WebSocketListener` trait provides various methods to handle different WebSocket events such as receiving a message and closing the connection.

```rust
use tokio::stream::StreamExt;
use tokio::sync::mpsc::{UnboundedReceiver, UnboundedSender};
use tokio_tungstenite::tungstenite::Message;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum ServerEvent {
    NewConnection(
        tungstenite::protocol::WebSocket<
            tokio_tungstenite::tungstenite::stream::Stream<
                tokio::net::TcpStream,
            >,
        >,
    ),
    Message(Message),
}

fn process_message(msg: Message) {
    match msg {
        Message::Text(txt) => {
            println!("Received a text message: {}", txt);
        }
        Message::Binary(bin) => {
            println!("Received a binary message: {:?}", bin);
        }
        _ => {}
    }
}

struct ChatService {
    tx: UnboundedSender<Message>,
}

impl WebSocketListener for ChatService {
    fn on_message(&self, msg: Message) {
        process_message(msg);
    }
}
```

The `ChatService` struct is our implementation of the `WebSocketListener` trait. We can then register a new service for each incoming connection:

```rust
// Listen for incoming connections
while let Some(stream) = server.next().await {
    match stream {
        Ok(ws_stream) => {
            let (tx, rx) = tokio::sync::mpsc::unbounded_channel();
            let peer_addr = ws_stream
                .peer_addr()
                .expect("WebSocket peer must have an IP address");
                
            let (service, _sender) = ChatService::new(tx);
            let challenge = Challenge::new_random();
            let accept_result = challenge.accept(&mut ws_stream);
            let (peer, ws_stream) = match accept_result {
                Ok(ws) => {
                    debug!("{}: WebSocket handshake successful", peer_addr);
                    let peer = Peer::new(ws_stream, service, rx, peer_addr);
                    (peer, ws)
                }
                Err(e) => {
                    error!(
                        "{}: WebSocket handshake failed: {}",
                        peer_addr, e
                    );
                    continue;
                }
            };

            tokio::spawn(async move {
                peer.run().await.unwrap_or_default();
            });
        }
        Err(e) => {
            eprintln!("Error accepting the incoming connection: {}", e);
            break;
        }
    }
}
```

### Implementing the Client

To implement the client, we must first create a WebSocket connection to the server. We can do this by using the `tokio-tungstenite` library.

```rust
let (ws_stream, _) = match tokio_tungstenite::connect_async("ws://127.0.0.1:8000").await {
    Ok((ws_stream, _)) => (ws_stream, tx),
    Err(e) => {
        eprintln!("Failed to connect to WebSocket server: {}", e);
        return;
    }
};
```

Once we have the WebSocket connection established, we can start sending messages:

```rust
let msg = Message::Text("Hello, World!".to_string());
ws_stream.send(msg).await.unwrap();
```

### Conclusion

In this post, we explored how to use Rust and WebSockets to build real-time, high-performance applications. We began by setting up the development environment and implemented the server and the client. A real-time application built with Rust and WebSockets can handle a large number of concurrent connections and offer a low-latency solution for real-time applications. Try this for your next project!
