Deno is a modern JavaScript and TypeScript runtime built using Rust. It is designed to be secure, performant, and maintainable. Deno is built with the latest web technologies and has a focus on server-side development. In this article, we will explore how to build high-performance websites using Deno.

## Installing Deno

Before we start, let's make sure we have Deno installed on our machine. We can easily do this with the help of `curl` or `powershell`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh

# or

iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

After Deno is installed, we can check its version using the following command:

```bash
deno --version
```

This should print out the current version of Deno that you have installed on your machine.

## Building a Server

Let's start by building a server that will serve our website. First, create an empty file `server.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts";

const server = serve({ port: 8000 });

for await (const request of server) {
  request.respond({ body: "Hello World\n" });
}
```

We are importing the `serve` function from the `http/server` module from the standard library and creating a new server that listens on port `8000`. When a request is made to the server, we respond with a "Hello World" message.

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
deno run --allow-net server.ts
```

This will start the server which will respond to all incoming requests on port `8000`.

## Serving Static Files

Now let's serve some static files. We can use the `serveStatic` function from the `https://deno.land/x/serve` module to serve static files from the `public` folder.

Create a `public` folder in the same directory as the `server.ts` file with an `index.html` file that has some simple HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Hello World</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
    <p>This page was served from Deno.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then add the following code to our `server.ts` file:

```typescript
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts";
import { serveStatic } from "https://deno.land/x/serve/mod.ts";

const server = serve({ port: 8000 });
const staticServer = serveStatic(".", { index: "index.html" });

for await (const request of server) {
  const result = await staticServer(request);
  if (result) {
    request.respond(result);
  }
}
```

The `serveStatic` function is used to create a static file server that will serve files from the current directory. We are providing an `index` option with the value of `"index.html"`, which specifies that when a directory is requested, `index.html` should be served.

## Adding TypeScript to Deno

Deno comes with first-class support for TypeScript. You can use TypeScript in your Deno projects by simply using `.ts` files instead of `.js` files. To use TypeScript with Deno, you don't need any additional setup.

Let's add a simple TypeScript file `main.ts` that uses a third-party package `lodash`:

```typescript
import * as _ from "https://deno.land/x/lodash/mod.ts";

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evens = _.filter(numbers, (n) => n % 2 === 0);

console.log(evens);
```

We are using the `filter` method from `lodash` to get all even numbers from an array of numbers.

To run this file, use the following command:

```bash
deno run --allow-net main.ts
```

Deno will automatically download the `lodash` package and cache it. If you run the same command again, it will use the cached version.

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored how to build high-performance websites using Deno. We learned how to create a server and serve static files using Deno's standard library. We also learned how to use TypeScript with Deno and how to use third-party packages. Deno's focus on security, performance, and maintainability makes it an excellent choice for building powerful and scalable web applications.
