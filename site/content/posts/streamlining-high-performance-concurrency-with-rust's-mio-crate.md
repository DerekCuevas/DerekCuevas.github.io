## Introduction

`Mio`, which stands for Metal I/O, is a low-level, non-blocking I/O library in Rust that provides the building blocks for implementing an event-driven architecture in a performance-critical application. It's the backbone of more high-level libraries like `Tokio`, providing a sleek, zero-cost abstraction over the OS's non-blocking system calls. This post will delve into getting the most out of `Mio` for high-performance I/O handling.

## The Core Components

At the heart of Mio are a few critical components: `Poll`, `Events`, `Token`, and `Evented`.

### Poll

`Poll` is perhaps the central component. It provides an efficient means to wait for readiness notifications from various I/O sources. Here's how you can instantiate a `Poll` instance.

```rust
let poll = Poll::new().unwrap();
```

### Evented

Anything that can be non-blocking and can generate readiness notifications implements the `Evented` trait. Sources like sockets, pipes, process channels all fall under this.

### Token and Events

`Token` is a type-safe wrapper for a `usize` value and is used to tie an `Evented` source to the readiness notifications that `Poll` receives. `Events` on the other hand, is a collection of readiness notifications for `Evented` handles.

```rust
// Creating a new Token
let token = Token(0); 

// Creating a mutable Events instance
let mut events = Events::with_capacity(1024);
```

## Registration and Polling 

Before `Poll` can receive an event from a source, that source must be registered with `Poll`. When you register an `Evented` source with `Poll`, you must specify the `Token` you'll use to identify readiness later.

```rust
// Create a TCP stream 
let stream = TcpStream::connect("127.0.0.1:3000".parse().unwrap()).unwrap();

// Register the stream with `Poll`, and tie it to our Token
poll.registry().register(&stream, token, Interest::READABLE | Interest::WRITABLE).unwrap();
```

Once you've registered your source, you can call `Poll::poll` and wait for readiness notifications.

```rust
poll.poll(&mut events, Some(Duration::from_millis(100))).unwrap();
```

## Handling Readiness

When `Poll::poll` returns, the `Events` instance you passed in will be filled with all the readiness notifications that happened since you last called `Poll`. You can then handle them as you see fit.

```rust
for event in events.iter() {
    match event.token() {
        token => {
            // Check the readiness state
            let readiness = event.readiness();

            if readiness.is_readable() {
                // The handle referred to by our token is ready for reading
            } else if readiness.is_writable() {
                // The handle referred to by our token is ready for writing
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

While `Mio` may be lower-level than some programmers might be used to (especially if you're coming from a language like Python), I hope this post made it clear just how powerful it can be. When you need to handle a large number of connections with minimal resource usage, `Mio` is one of the best tools you can have in your toolbox. It enables you to build high-performance network applications right 'on the metal', without the need for any intermediary abstractions. Its zero-cost abstraction and granular control over the system's non-blocking calls can enable programmers to squeeze out every bit of performance from their applications.
