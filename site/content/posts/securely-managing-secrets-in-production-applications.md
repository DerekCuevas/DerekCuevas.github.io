When deploying an application to production, it is important to manage secrets such as passwords, API keys, and private encryption keys securely. The traditional approach is to hardcode these secrets into the application code or configuration files, but that is insecure and often leads to vulnerabilities when leaked. In this post, we will explore better ways to manage secrets in production.

## Secret Management Tools

Secret management tools provide a better way to store and manage secrets in production. These tools allow secrets to be stored separately from the application code, and to be encrypted at rest. The tools also provide access control and audit trails for managing secrets. There are many secret management tools available, including:

### HashiCorp Vault

[HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is an open-source secret management tool that allows storage and dynamic retrieval of secrets. It provides fine-grained access control, auditing, and secret revocation. Vault also has a feature called "dynamic secrets", which allows it to generate temporary credentials for services like databases, ensuring that even if those credentials are leaked, they will eventually become invalid.

### AWS Secrets Manager

[AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) is a managed secret management service that allows storage and retrieval of secrets used in AWS services, such as RDS databases and EC2 instances. Secrets Manager provides automatic rotation of secrets, integrating with AWS Lambda to ensure that the new secrets are updated in all relevant systems.

### Google Cloud Secret Manager

[Google Cloud Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager) is a managed secret management service that allows storage and retrieval of secrets used in Google Cloud Platform services, such as BigQuery and Cloud SQL. Secret Manager provides access control and audit logging, and integrates with other Google Cloud Platform services.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables provide a convenient way to pass configuration information, including secrets, to an application at runtime. Environment variables can be set in the operating system, or in a service like Kubernetes. Environment variables are a better approach than storing secrets in configuration files because they can be passed to an application without being stored on disk.

In node.js, environment variables can be accessed using the `process.env` object. For example, to access the value of an environment variable called `DB_PASSWORD`, you can use:

```javascript
const password = process.env.DB_PASSWORD;
```

In Python, environment variables can be accessed using the `os` module. For example, to access the value of an environment variable called `DB_PASSWORD`, you can use:

```python
import os

password = os.environ['DB_PASSWORD']
```

## Secrets Injection

Another approach to managing secrets in production is secret injection. Secret injection involves injecting secrets into the application at runtime, instead of storing them in configuration files or environment variables. This provides a more secure way to manage secrets because they are never stored on disk or transmitted over the network.

Kubernetes provides built-in support for secret injection using Kubernetes secrets. Secrets can be created using the `kubectl` command-line tool, and can be injected into a container as environment variables or mounted as a file. For example, to inject a secret called `db-password` into a container as an environment variable called `DB_PASSWORD`, you can use:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: db-password
stringData:
  password: supersecret
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 1
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: my-app
          image: my-app:v1
          env:
            - name: DB_PASSWORD
              valueFrom:
                secretKeyRef:
                  name: db-password
                  key: password
```

## Conclusion

Managing secrets in production is a critical security concern. Instead of hardcoding secrets into the application code or configuration files, they should be managed using secret management tools, environment variables, or secret injection. By properly managing secrets, you can reduce the risk of security vulnerabilities in your production application.
