Elm is a functional, strongly typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript. Elm is known for being easy to learn, with helpful error messages and an intuitive syntax. However, it is not always known for being performant. In this article, we'll explore how to use web workers to write high performance Elm code.

## What are web workers?

Web workers allow you to run a JavaScript file in a separate thread from the main thread of your application. This can be useful for long running tasks that could slow down the performance of your main thread or cause it to lock up entirely. By offloading these tasks to a web worker, your application can remain responsive and fast. Web workers are supported by all modern browsers.

## Why use web workers with Elm?

One of the challenges with Elm is that it is a single-threaded language. This means that all code is executed on the main thread, which can lead to performance problems when performing computationally expensive tasks. By using web workers, we can take advantage of the extra processing power available in the user's machine, without slowing down the main thread of our application.

## How to use web workers with Elm

To use a web worker with Elm, we first need to create a JavaScript file that defines the worker code. In this file, we can define functions that perform the work we want to offload to the worker thread. For example, let's say we want to perform a computationally expensive calculation. We could define a function like this:

```javascript
// worker.js
function expensiveCalculation(a, b) {
  let result = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < 10000000000; i++) {
    result += a * b;
  }
  return result;
}
```

In our Elm code, we can then create a worker using the `Task` module. The `Task` module provides a simple interface for working with web workers. Here's an example of how we could create a worker to perform our expensive calculation:

```elm
import Task exposing (Task)
import Json.Encode as Encode
import Json.Decode as Decode

port dataFromWorker : (Encode.Value -> msg) -> Sub msg

performExpensiveCalculation : Float -> Float -> Task x Float
performExpensiveCalculation a b =
  let
    workerConfig =
      { task =
          "expose" : ["expensiveCalculation"] }

    input =
      [ a, b ]
  in
    Decode.float
      |> Task.asyncWorker
      |> Task.mapResult Decode.decodeValue
      |> Task.andThen Task.succeed
```

In this example, we're exposing the `expensiveCalculation` function that we defined in our JavaScript worker code. We're then passing in the inputs `a` and `b` and waiting for the worker to finish processing before returning the result.

Finally, we need to instantiate the worker in our Elm code by subscribing to the `dataFromWorker` port. Here's an example of how we could do that:

```elm
expensiveCalculation : Float -> Float -> Sub Float
expensiveCalculation a b =
  let
    input =
      Encode.list Encode.float [ a, b ]

    onMessage =
      \msg -> case msg of
        Ok result ->
          floatResult result

        Err err ->
          Debug.crash err
  in
    ports.dataFromWorker
      (\value -> onMessage (Decode.decodeValue value))
```

In this example, we're encoding the inputs `a` and `b` as a list of floats, and then subscribing to the `dataFromWorker` port using a decoder that converts the result back into a float.

When we call `expensiveCalculation` with our input values, our Elm code will send a message to the web worker, which will perform the expensive calculation and return the result back to Elm through the port. Once the result is received, our Elm code will display it to the user.

## Conclusion

By using web workers to offload expensive tasks to a separate thread, we can write high performance Elm code that remains responsive and fast, even when performing computationally expensive tasks. While using web workers with Elm requires some extra setup compared to traditional JavaScript code, it is well worth the effort for applications that require high performance.
