## Introduction

In today's world, with an ever-growing amount of data to process, making effective use of available resources becomes a necessity. While single-threaded applications seem to be a thing of the past, the shift towards multi-threading is gaining momentum. Clojure is known to provide excellent support for concurrency. In this post, we'll explore the principles of multithreading with Clojure.

## Understanding Concurrency

First, let's gain a basic understanding of concurrency:

>Concurrency is a property of systems in which several independent tasks are executing simultaneously.

However, there's a difference between concurrency and parallelism:

>Parallelism is the simultaneous execution of multiple tasks on multiple processors.

So, although two tasks may appear to execute at the same time, with multithreading, they're actually executing on separate processors.

## Creating Threads with 'future'

Clojure provides the 'future' macro for creating new threads. Here's an example that demonstrates creating a thread using the future macro to calculate the square of a number:

```clojure
(defn square [x]
  (* x x))

(def result (future (square 5)))
```

In the above example, we define a function 'square' that accepts a number as an argument and returns the square of the number. Next, we create a new thread that will run the 'square' function and we pass the number 5 as an argument. We assign the result of the future function to a variable named 'result'. Once the future is completed, we can retrieve its value by dereferencing the future as shown below:

```clojure
@(future-value result)
```

The '@' symbol is a shorthand notation of 'deref'. 

## Using 'promise' for communication

One way to communicate between threads is to use a promise which provides a way for a thread to communicate a value to another thread. Let's illustrate this by updating the previous example:

```clojure
(defn square [x]
  (* x x))

(def p (promise))

(future
  (deliver p (square 5)))

(deref p)
```

In the above example, we first create a promise using the 'promise' function. Next, we create a thread and call the square function with the argument 5. Once the result of the square function is available, we use the deliver function on the promise to send the value to the main thread. Finally, we use the deref function on the promise to get the value received, which should be 25.

## Synchronized Access

While we're on the topic of communication between threads, it's important to look at how synchronization works in Clojure. Synchronization is used to ensure that different threads access a shared resource one at a time, hence avoiding any race conditions and ensuring consistency. Here's an example that demonstrates synchronized access to a shared resource:

```clojure
(def counter (atom 0))

(defn increment []
  (swap! counter inc))

(dotimes [n 10]
  (future (dotimes [m 10000]
            (increment))))


Thread/sleep 3000

(prn @counter)
```

In the above example, we define the 'counter' variable which is an atom with an initial value of 0. Next, we define the 'increment' function which uses the 'swap!' function to increment the counter. We create ten threads, and each thread runs a loop that calls the 'increment' function 10,000 times. After all the threads have finished executing, we wait for 3 seconds and print the counter value. Since the threads are synchronized, the counter should be 100,000.

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored the fundamental principles of multithreading with Clojure. We covered how to create threads using the 'future' macro, how to communicate between threads using 'promise', and how to use synchronization to ensure consistency while accessing shared resources. Multithreading is a powerful tool in the arsenal of a software developer, and it's important to understand how to use this tool effectively in order to create safe and efficient software.
