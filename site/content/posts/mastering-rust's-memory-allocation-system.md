Rust is a language that provides fine-grained control over system resources, especially memory. One of the areas where Rust shines is its memory allocation system. Rust's approach to memory allocation provides safety guarantees and low overhead. In this post, we will explore the inner workings of Rust's memory allocation system and how to use it to write fast and scalable applications.

## Stack and Heap Memory

When a program runs, it uses two types of memory: stack and heap. Stack memory stores data that has a fixed size and lifetime. For example, local variables and arguments to a function are stored on the stack. Heap memory, on the other hand, is used for data that has a dynamic size and lifetime. The heap is where we allocate data structures like Vec or Box.

In Rust, the stack is managed by the compiler, and the heap is managed by the programmer with the help of the std::alloc module. The std::alloc module provides a set of functions for allocating and deallocating memory from the heap.

## Allocating Memory

To allocate memory from the heap, we use the `alloc` function. The `alloc` function takes a size parameter and returns a pointer to the allocated memory region. The `alloc` function is defined as follows:

```
pub fn alloc(layout: Layout) -> *mut u8
```

The `Layout` parameter specifies the size and alignment requirements for the allocated memory. For example, to allocate 64 bytes of memory, we can use the following code:

```rust
use std::alloc::{alloc, Layout};

let layout = Layout::from_size_align(64, 8).unwrap();
let ptr = unsafe { alloc(layout) };
```

In this example, we create a `Layout` object with a size of 64 bytes and an alignment of 8 bytes. We then pass the `Layout` object to the `alloc` function, which returns a pointer to the allocated memory region. Note that we need to use the `unsafe` keyword here because `alloc` is an unsafe function.

## Freeing Memory

To free memory that was allocated with `alloc`, we use the `dealloc` function. The `dealloc` function takes a pointer to the memory region that was allocated and deallocates it. The `dealloc` function is defined as follows:

```
pub fn dealloc(ptr: *mut u8, layout: Layout)
```

For example, to free the memory that we allocated in the previous section, we can use the following code:

```rust
use std::alloc::{dealloc, Layout};

let layout = Layout::from_size_align(64, 8).unwrap();
let ptr = unsafe { alloc(layout) };

unsafe { dealloc(ptr, layout) };
```

In this example, we use the `dealloc` function to free the memory that was previously allocated with `alloc`.

## Allocating Arrays

To allocate an array in Rust, we can use the `alloc_array` function. The `alloc_array` function is similar to `alloc`, but it takes an additional parameter that specifies the number of elements in the array. The `alloc_array` function is defined as follows:

```
pub fn alloc_array<T>(count: usize, layout: Layout) -> *mut T
```

For example, to allocate an array of 10 integers, we can use the following code:

```rust
use std::alloc::{alloc_array, Layout};

let layout = Layout::array::<i32>(10).unwrap();
let ptr = unsafe { alloc_array::<i32>(10, layout) };
```

In this example, we create a `Layout` object that represents an array of 10 integers. We then pass the `Layout` object to the `alloc_array` function along with the type of the elements in the array (`i32` in this case). The `alloc_array` function returns a pointer to the allocated memory region.

## Allocating and Initializing a Vec

Vectors are dynamically sized arrays in Rust. Rust's standard library provides the `Vec` type, which is a growable array. To allocate and initialize a `Vec`, we can use the `Vec::with_capacity` method. The `with_capacity` method takes a number that specifies the initial capacity of the vector. Here is an example:

```rust
let mut v = Vec::with_capacity(10);

for i in 0..10 {
    v.push(i);
}
```

In this example, we allocate a `Vec` with an initial capacity of 10. We then use a loop to push 10 integers into the vector.

## Conclusion

Rust's memory allocation system provides a safe and efficient way to allocate memory from the heap. By understanding how Rust's memory allocation works, you can write faster and more scalable applications. Remember to always use the `dealloc` function to free memory that you allocate with `alloc`.
