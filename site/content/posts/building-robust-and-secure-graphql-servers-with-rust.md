GraphQL is a popular query language for APIs that allows clients to retrieve the exact data they need, and nothing more. It provides a powerful and flexible interface for fetching data from a server, but at the same time, it can introduce security vulnerabilities if not handled correctly. As a systems programming language, Rust offers safety and performance guarantees that can help build secure GraphQL servers to prevent attacks. 

In this post, we'll discuss some of the best practices to build robust and secure GraphQL servers in Rust and explore some of the common security vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them.

## Securing GraphQL Servers

### Use Application-Level Authorization

One of the key principles of securing GraphQL servers is to have fine-grained control over who can access the data. Each field in GraphQL can include authorization logic that determines whether a user is authorized to access the data or not. Rust provides a powerful type system that can be used to model the authentication and authorization logic of a GraphQL server and helps ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data.

```rust
struct Query;

#[juniper::graphql_object(
    Context = Context,
)]
impl Query {
    #[graphql(description = "Get user by ID")]
    fn user(id: ID, context: &Context) -> FieldResult<User> {
        let user = context
            .user_repository
            .find_by_id(&id.parse().unwrap())?;

        if let Some(auth) = &context.auth {
            if !auth.is_admin && auth.user_id != user.id {
                return FieldResult::Err(FieldError::new(
                    "Not authorized",
                    graphql_value!({ "code": "403" }),
                ));
            }
        }

        Ok(user)
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `user` field is secured by checking whether the current user is an admin or they are querying their own profile. If the user is not authorized, the field returns an error. This technique can be used for any field that needs to be secured.

### Validate and Sanitize User Input

Another security concern is to validate and sanitize the user's input to prevent malicious attacks like injection and escalation. Rust provides a robust type system and libraries for parsing and validating input, which can be used to ensure that the input is in the expected format and within the acceptable range of values.

```rust
#[derive(Debug, PartialEq, Deserialize)]
struct LoginInput {
    email: String,
    password: String,
}

#[juniper::graphql_object(
    Context = Context,
)]
impl Mutation {
    #[graphql(description = "Login user")]
    fn login(input: LoginInput, context: &Context) -> FieldResult<String> {
        let user = context
            .user_repository
            .find_by_email(&input.email)?;

        if user.password != input.password {
            return Err(FieldError::new(
                "Invalid password",
                graphql_value!({ "code": "401" }),
            ));
        }

        let token = context.jwt.encode(&Claims::new(user.id))?;

        Ok(token)
    }
}
```

In the above example, the `LoginInput` struct is validated to ensure that both email and password fields are populated and are of the correct data type. Additionally, the password is checked against the one stored in the database for the user before signing the JWT token.

### Limit Query Depth and Complexity

GraphQL allows clients to construct complex and deep queries, often leading to excessive load on the server. One way to mitigate this is to limit the query depth and complexity allowed in the server. Juniper, a Rust library for building GraphQL servers, provides a built-in mechanism to limit the query complexity based on the number of nodes, fields, and depth levels.

```rust
let schema = Schema::new(
    Query::new(),
    Mutation::new(),
    EmptySubscription::new(),
)
.limit_complexity(10000)
.limit_depth(10);
```

The above code sets a complexity limit of 10,000 nodes and a depth limit of 10 levels. Fields that exceed these limits are pruned before the query is executed by the server, preventing inefficient queries from consuming server resources.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, Rust offers a high-performance and secure platform for building GraphQL servers. By using Rust's type and memory safety, query validation, and input sanitation features, we can build robust and secure GraphQL servers that prevent attacks and ensure data privacy.
