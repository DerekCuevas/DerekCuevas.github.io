GraphQL is quickly becoming a go-to choice for web APIs due to its flexibility and ability to reduce network traffic. However, with great flexibility comes great responsibility. GraphQL APIs have unique security considerations, such as query complexity attacks, and require robust input validation that matches the GraphQL schema. Rust, with its memory safety and strong typing, is an excellent language to build secure and robust GraphQL servers.

In this post, we will explore how to use Rust to build secure and robust GraphQL servers. We will cover:

1. Initializing a Rust project and adding dependencies
2. Defining the GraphQL schema
3. Validating inputs according to the schema
4. Handling complex queries and security concerns

## Initializing a Rust Project and Adding Dependencies

We will use the popular Rust web framework [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/) to build our GraphQL server. Rocket provides a clean and simple API for building web applications and has a growing library of plugins. To use Rocket in a new Rust project, we can use the following command:

```bash
$ cargo new my-graphql-server --bin
```

This will create a new Rust project with a binary target, which is appropriate for a web server. Then we will add Rocket as a dependency in `Cargo.toml`.

```toml
[dependencies]
rocket = "0.5.0-rc.1"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
juniper = "0.16"
```

We will use serde for serialization and deserialization, and Juniper to define our GraphQL schema.

## Defining the GraphQL Schema

The GraphQL schema defines the types and fields available in the API. Juniper uses Rust types to define the GraphQL schema. Here is an example schema:

```rust
#[derive(Clone, Debug, GraphQLObject)]
struct User {
    id: ID,
    name: String,
    email: String,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug, GraphQLObject)]
struct Task {
    id: ID,
    title: String,
    description: String,
    done: bool,
}

#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Context {
    users: Vec<User>,
    tasks: Vec<Task>,
}

#[rocket::async_trait]
impl juniper::Context for Context {}

type Schema = juniper::RootNode<'static, Query, Mutation>;

struct Query;

#[juniper::graphql_object(Context = Context)]
impl Query {
    #[graphql(description = "List all users")]
    async fn users() -> Vec<User> {
        // implementation omitted
    }

    #[graphql(description = "Get a user by ID")]
    async fn user(&self, id: ID) -> Option<User> {
        // implementation omitted
    }

    #[graphql(description = "List all tasks")]
    async fn tasks() -> Vec<Task> {
        // implementation omitted
    }
}

struct Mutation;

#[juniper::graphql_object(Context = Context)]
impl Mutation {
    #[graphql(description = "Create a new task")]
    async fn create_task(&self, title: String, description: String) -> Task {
        // implementation omitted
    }

    #[graphql(description = "Mark a task as done")]
    async fn mark_task_done(&self, id: ID) -> Option<Task> {
        // implementation omitted
    }
}

fn create_schema() -> Schema {
    Schema::new(Query, Mutation)
}
```

In this example, we define two types, `User` and `Task`, and a context struct that holds some data. We implement the `juniper::Context` trait for the context struct so that it can be used in GraphQL resolvers.

We define the `Query` and `Mutation` structs which will be used by Juniper to generate resolvers. The `Query` struct defines functions that correspond to root query fields in the schema. Similarly, the `Mutation` struct defines functions that correspond to root mutation fields in the schema.

Finally, we define a function `create_schema()` that returns a `Schema` object. This function takes the root query and mutation structs as arguments and generates a GraphQL schema that can be used in our application.

## Validating Inputs According to the Schema

One of the benefits of GraphQL is that clients can specify exactly which fields they want in a query, leading to reduced network traffic. However, this also means that input validation is more important because a client could potentially request fields that don't exist or request data that they shouldn't have access to.

Juniper automatically validates queries against the defined schema, so we don't have to worry about requests for nonexistent fields. However, we do have to make sure that the input data matches the schema. For example, if our schema specifies that a user's email must be a valid email address, we need to validate input to ensure that this requirement is met.

To validate input data, we can use Rust's strong typing and Rocket's request guard functionality. Here is an example of a guard that checks if an email address is valid:

```rust
#[rocket::async_trait]
impl<'r> rocket::request::FromRequest<'r> for Email {
    type Error = String;

    async fn from_request(
        request: &'r rocket::Request<'_>,
    ) -> rocket::request::Outcome<Self, Self::Error> {
        let email: String = match request
            .headers()
            .get_one("X-Email")
            .ok_or_else(|| "X-Email header is missing".to_string())?
        {
            email if is_valid_email(&email) => Ok(email.to_string()),
            _ => Err("Invalid email".to_string()),
        };

        Outcome::Success(Email(email?))
    }
}

struct Email(String);

fn is_valid_email(email: &str) -> bool {
    // implementation omitted
}
```

In this example, we define a `FromRequest` guard that extracts an email address from the `X-Email` header and checks if it's a valid email address. If it's valid, we return an `Outcome::Success` with an `Email` object containing the email address. If it's not valid, we return an `Outcome::Failure` with an error message.

Guards like these can be used to validate any input data that comes from a request, including data from query variables and mutations.

## Handling Complex Queries and Security Concerns

One of the challenges of building a GraphQL server is handling complex queries from clients. Clients can define arbitrarily complex queries that join multiple types together, which can result in a large number of database queries. This can lead to performance problems and create a potential vulnerability for query complexity attacks.

One way to handle complex queries is to use a data loader. A data loader is a mechanism for batching and caching queries to a data source. By batching queries together, we can reduce the number of queries made to the database. By caching the results of queries, we can reduce the latency of subsequent requests.

For example, let's say we have a GraphQL query that requests a user's tasks and the names of their collaborators:

```graphql
query GetUserTasks {
  user(id: "1") {
    name
    tasks {
      title
      collaborators {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If we naively execute this query, we might end up issuing two database queries per task (one for the task's fields and one for the collaborator's fields). This can quickly become a performance bottleneck.

To solve this problem, we can use a data loader to batch and cache queries. Here is an example using the [dataloader](https://github.com/graphql-rust/dataloader) crate:

```rust
struct CollaboratorLoader {
    db: Database,
}

impl CollaboratorLoader {
    async fn load_collaborators(&self, task_ids: Vec<ID>) -> Result<Vec<Vec<Collaborator>>, Error> {
        // implementation omitted
    }
}

impl juniper::Context for Context {}

struct Query;

#[juniper::graphql_object(Context = Context)]
impl Query {
    async fn user(&self, id: ID) -> Option<User> {
        // implementation omitted
    }

    async fn task(&self, id: ID) -> Option<Task> {
        // implementation omitted
    }

    async fn tasks(&self, user_id: Option<ID>) -> Vec<Task> {
        // implementation omitted
    }
}

fn create_collaborator_loader(db: Database) -> CollaboratorLoader {
    CollaboratorLoader { db }
}

type CollaboratorLoaderKey = String;
type CollaboratorLoaderValue = Vec<Collaborator>;

#[rocket::async_trait]
impl<'a> FromRequest<'a> for Arc<DataLoader<CollaboratorLoaderKey, CollaboratorLoaderValue>> {
    type Error = ();

    async fn from_request(request: &'a Request<'_>) -> Outcome<Self, Self::Error> {
        let db = request.local_cache(|| {
            let db_url = std::env::var("DATABASE_URL").expect("missing DATABASE_URL environment variable");
            Database::connect(&db_url).expect("failed to connect to database")
        });

        let loader_key = "collaborator".to_string();
        let loader = DataLoader::new(create_collaborator_loader(db), loader_key.clone());

        Outcome::Success(Arc::new(loader))
    }
}
