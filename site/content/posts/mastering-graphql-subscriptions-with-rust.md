GraphQL is a popular query language for APIs that provides a strong typing system and efficient, predictable queries. GraphQL subscriptions build on this by providing a framework for real-time communication between servers and clients. In this article, we will explore the basics of GraphQL subscriptions and demonstrate how Rust, with its powerful concurrency and real-time capabilities, can be used to build scalable and performant subscription servers.

## GraphQL Subscriptions: An Overview

GraphQL is an API query language that allows clients to specify exactly what data they need and receive it in a predictable and efficient manner. In addition to its query and mutation functionality, GraphQL also provides subscriptions, which allow clients to subscribe to real-time updates from a server.

GraphQL subscriptions are implemented using WebSockets, a protocol that allows for bidirectional communication between a client and server over a single TCP connection. Clients can subscribe to a specific event (or set of events) on the server, and the server will send updates to all subscribed clients whenever those events occur. These updates can be in the form of any valid GraphQL document, allowing for a wide variety of use cases.

## Implementing GraphQL Subscriptions in Rust

Implementing GraphQL subscriptions in Rust is straightforward using libraries like [async-graphql](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql) and [tokio](https://tokio.rs/). In this example, we will build a simple subscription server that sends updates whenever a counter variable changes.

First, we will declare our GraphQL schema using the [async-graphql](https://github.com/async-graphql/async-graphql) crate:

```rust
use async_graphql::*;

struct SubscriptionRoot;

#[Object]
impl SubscriptionRoot {
    async fn counter(&self) -> impl Stream<Item = i32> {
        // ...
    }
}

struct QueryRoot;

#[Object]
impl QueryRoot {
    async fn hello(&self) -> String {
        "world".to_string()
    }
}

type Schema = async_graphql::Schema<QueryRoot, MutationRoot, SubscriptionRoot>;
```

In this example, we define a `SubscriptionRoot` struct that contains a single `counter` method. This method returns a `Stream<Item = i32>`, which is a Rust `Stream` that will be used to send updates to subscribed clients.

To start the subscription server, we can use the following code:

```rust
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    let schema = Schema::new(QueryRoot {}, MutationRoot {}, SubscriptionRoot {});

    let addr = "127.0.0.1:8000".parse().unwrap();
    let listener = TcpListener::bind(&addr).await.unwrap();
    let schema = Arc::new(schema);

    while let Ok((stream, _)) = listener.accept().await {
        let peer_addr = stream.peer_addr().unwrap();
        let schema = schema.clone();

        tokio::spawn(async move {
            if let Err(e) = async_graphql::http::WebSocket::new(async_graphql::http::WebSocketConfig::default(), stream, |value| async move {
                let result = schema.execute(value).await;
                Ok::<_, serde_json::Error>(serde_json::to_string(&result).unwrap())
            })
            .await
            {
                eprintln!("{}: failed to accept websocket: {:?}", peer_addr, e);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

This code creates a `TcpListener` that listens for incoming WebSocket connections on port 8000. Whenever a new connection is established, the server creates a new `async_graphql::http::WebSocket` and adds it to a `tokio::spawn` task for concurrency. The `WebSocket` is configured to use the previously defined GraphQL schema and to execute any received messages. The resulting GraphQL response is then sent back to the client over the WebSocket connection.

To implement the `counter` method, we will use Rust's `futures` and `tokio` libraries to create an `mpsc` channel that sends updates to subscribed clients. We will also add a simple `set_counter` mutation that updates the counter variable.

```rust
use futures::stream::StreamExt;
use std::{sync::Arc, time::Duration};
use tokio::sync::mpsc;

let (tx, rx) = mpsc::unbounded_channel::<i32>();

tokio::spawn(async move {
    let mut count = 0;

    loop {
        count += 1;
        tx.send(count).unwrap();
        tokio::time::delay_for(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
    }
});

#[Object]
impl SubscriptionRoot {
    async fn counter(&self) -> impl Stream<Item = i32> {
        rx.map(|count| {
            println!("Sending count of {}", count);
            count
        })
    }
}

struct MutationRoot;

#[Object]
impl MutationRoot {
    async fn set_counter(&self, counter: i32) -> i32 {
        tx.send(counter).unwrap();
        counter
    }
}
```

In this example, we create an unbounded `mpsc` channel that will be used to send updates to subscribed clients. We then spawn a new task using `tokio::spawn` that increments the counter variable every second and sends it over the channel. The `counter` method on `SubscriptionRoot` simply returns a new Rust `Stream` created from the channel's receiver, which will send updates to any subscribed clients. Finally, we define a `set_counter` mutation that allows clients to manually set the counter variable.

## Conclusion

GraphQL subscriptions provide a powerful framework for real-time communication between servers and clients. Rust's real-time capabilities and powerful concurrency make it an excellent choice for building GraphQL subscription servers that can scale to handle high volumes of real-time data. By leveraging Rust's async/await syntax and libraries like `async-graphql` and `tokio`, developers can quickly build efficient and scalable subscription servers that provide real-time updates to clients.
