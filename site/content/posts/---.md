# Exploring Rust's Memory Allocators: Navigating the Jemalloc and System Alternatives

## Introduction 

In the world of system programming, memory management is a fundamental topic. Rust, a language designed for system programming due to its safety, speed, and concurrency features, makes no exception. Many are familiar with Rust's unique approach to memory safety through its ownership model, but fewer might be familiar with the memory allocators it provides: `Jemalloc` and `System`.

In this post, we will dig into the Rust's memory allocators, their working principles, and how to use them effectively.

## Overview of Memory Allocators

A memory allocator is responsible for managing a process's memory: allocating blocks when needed and freeing them when they are no longer in use. Rust uses the `Jemalloc` allocator by default in many of its systems.

By default, Rust used to include `Jemalloc` to allocate and deallocate memory. Still, starting from version 1.28.0, Rust is bundled with its allocator, which falls back to the system's default allocator if `Jemalloc` is not available.

## Jemalloc

`Jemalloc` is a general-purpose scalable concurrent allocator. Developed for FreeBSD, `Jemalloc` has become the default memory allocator for many systems due to its outstanding performance characteristics. 

One of the features `Jemalloc` offers is "arenas", which are essentially independent memory regions that reduce lock contention in multithreaded programs.

The Rust standard library, when compiled with `--features=Jemalloc`, will use this allocator by default in place of the system's default. However, starting with Rust 1.28.0, `Jemalloc` is no longer the default allocator, but it is still available.

Here is how you can use `jemallocator` crate to replace the global allocator in a Rust program:

```rust
// Make sure you add the following to your Cargo.toml: 
// jemallocator = "0.3.2"
use jemallocator::Jemalloc;

#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: Jemalloc = Jemalloc;

fn main() {
    let _vec = vec![0_u8; 1024];
}
```
The `#[global_allocator]` attribute allows you to set the memory allocator for your program.

By default, Rust will use the system allocator. However, we are now telling it to use `Jemalloc` instead.

## System Allocator

If `Jemalloc` isn't available, Rust falls back to the system allocator. The system allocator is included with the operating system, and it's what malloc/free are based on in C/C++. This allocator is generally less performant and less feature-rich than `Jemalloc`.

Since Rust 1.28.0, the system allocator became the default due to various issues surrounding `Jemalloc`, such as long compilation times.

Here is an example of how it is possible to enforce the usage of the system allocator in a Rust program:

```rust
use std::alloc::System;

#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: System = System;

fn main() {
    let _vec = vec![0_u8; 1024];
}
```
In this code, we've told Rust to use the system allocator instead of `Jemalloc`.

The choice of allocator can have significant impact on a program's performance. Therefore, it could be beneficial to benchmark your application using both allocators to decide which one is the best fit.

## Conclusion

Understanding the inner workings of memory allocators and how to choose the correct one helps developers gain more control over their low-level programs. The decision between `Jemalloc` and the system allocator depends on the needs and context of your Rust application. While `Jemalloc` often provides better performance, using the system allocator can greatly reduce compilation times and simplify the build process. Understanding these aspects can significantly influence the performance and efficiency of your Rust applications.
