Rust, which is a low-level systems programming language, was designed to support building blazingly fast, high-performance systems that consume minimal resources. This makes it an ideal choice for building streaming systems that can ingest, process, and output large data volumes in real-time. In this tutorial, we'll explore how to build a high-performance streaming system with Rust that can handle large volumes of data while remaining efficient and fast.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need to have the following prerequisites:

- A basic understanding of Rust programming language.
- Knowledge of asynchronous programming.
- Familiarity with networking protocols.

## Building a High-Performance Data Ingestion System

The first step in building a high-performance streaming system is creating an efficient data ingestion process that can handle large volumes of data. For this, we'll use the Rust programming language along with the Tokio library, which is designed to support asynchronous programming and is particularly suited for high-performance network applications.

Let's start by installing the required Rust dependencies:

```bash
cargo new --bin data-ingestion
cd data-ingestion
```

Next, we'll add the following dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file:

```bash
[dependencies]
tokio = { version = "1.10", features = ["full"] }
futures = "0.3"
```

The `futures` crate is a dependency of the Tokio library, which provides a set of low-level primitives for building asynchronous APIs in Rust.

In this sample system, we'll use Rust's threads to read data from a file, transform it, and insert it into a PostgreSQL database. We'll then use a futures channel to notify the processing system that new data is available.

```rust
use tokio::sync::{mpsc, oneshot};

// Define message type to get notified of available data
enum Message {
    Data(Vec<String>),
    Terminate(oneshot::Sender<()>),
}

// Start the data ingestion system
#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create a channel to send data to the processing system
    let (tx, mut rx) = mpsc::channel::<Message>(1_000);

    // Start a new thread to read data from a file
    let data_thread = std::thread::spawn(move || {
        let data = read_file("data.csv");
        let chunks = chunk_data(data, 1_000);

        // Send the data to processing system
        for chunk in chunks {
            let _ = tx.blocking_send(Message::Data(chunk));
        }

        // Notify processing system that we're done
        let _ = tx.blocking_send(Message::Terminate(oneshot::channel().0));
    });

    // Start the processing system
    let mut processed_count: usize = 0;
    loop {
        match rx.recv().await.unwrap() {
            Message::Data(mut raw_data) => {
                // Process the data chunk
                let processed_data = process_data(&mut raw_data);

                // Insert the processed data into PostgreSQL
                insert_data_into_pg(&processed_data);

                // Increment processed count
                processed_count += raw_data.len();
            }
            Message::Terminate(terminate_tx) => {
                // Notify the thread that data has been consumed
                let _ = terminate_tx.send(());
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    // Wait for the thread to complete
    let _ = data_thread.join();
}

// Read data from file
fn read_file(file: &str) -> Vec<String> {
    // omitted for brevity
}

// Chunk data for processing
fn chunk_data(mut data: Vec<String>, chunk_size: usize) -> Vec<Vec<String>> {
    // omitted for brevity
}

// Process data
fn process_data(raw_data: &mut Vec<String>) -> Vec<ProcessedData> {
    // omitted for brevity
}

// Insert data into PostgreSQL
fn insert_data_into_pg(processed_data: &Vec<ProcessedData>) {
    // omitted for brevity
}
```

In the above code, we're using the Tokio `mpsc` channel to send data from the data ingestion system to the processing system. We're also using the `oneshot` channel to notify the data ingestion system that the processing system has finished and new data is available.

## Building a High-Performance Data Processing System

The next step in building a high-performance streaming system is creating a fast and efficient data processing system. In this section, we'll explore how to use Rust and the Actix Web framework to create a high-performance data processing system that can handle a large volume of data.

First, let's install the required dependencies.

```bash
cargo new --bin data-processing
cd data-processing
```

Next, add the following dependencies to the `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
actix-web = "4.0"
tokio = { version = "1.10", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
```

Actix Web is a high-performance web framework that runs on Rust. It provides a set of tools to design and build a fast and scalable HTTP server.

Our sample system will use an Actix Web server that listens on a Unix domain socket. For each incoming request, we'll spawn a new thread to process the data and respond back to the client.

```rust
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpRequest, HttpResponse, HttpServer, Responder};
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

// POSIX Unix socket path to listen to
const SOCKET_PATH: &str = "/tmp/data-processing.sock";

// Model for processed data
#[derive(Debug, Deserialize, Serialize)]
struct ProcessedData {
    id: String,
    name: String,
    value: f64,
}

// Define handler for incoming request
async fn process_data(req: HttpRequest, payload: String) -> impl Responder {
    let data: Vec<String> = serde_json::from_str(&payload).unwrap();

    // Process the data
    let processed_data = process_data(&mut data.clone());

    // Return processed data
    HttpResponse::Ok().json(processed_data)
}

// Start the data processing system
#[actix_rt::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    // Create the Actix Web Server
    let server = HttpServer::new(|| {
        App::new()
            .route("/", web::post().to(process_data))
    });

    // Listen on the specified Unix domain socket
    let _ = server.listen_uds(SOCKET_PATH)?;

    // Wait for connections to be made and process data
    server.await?;

    Ok(())
}

// Process the data
fn process_data(raw_data: &mut Vec<String>) -> Vec<ProcessedData> {
    // omitted for brevity
}
```

In the code above, we first define a `ProcessedData` struct to model the processed data. We then define a handler function called `process_data`, which takes in an HTTP request containing a JSON payload of raw data. This handler function processes the data and returns the processed data to the client.

Finally, we define a main function that creates an Actix Web server and listens on a Unix domain socket. For each incoming request, we process the data and send the processed data back to the client.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we explored how to use Rust programming language to build a high-performance streaming system that can handle large volumes of data. We first explored how to build a high-performance data ingestion system using Rust threads, the Tokio library, and a futures channel. We then explored how to build a high-performance data processing system using Rust and the Actix Web framework.

With these two simple systems, you can build an end-to-end streaming system that can ingest, process, and output large volumes of data in real-time. Rust's performance capabilities, combined with its low resource utilization, make it an ideal choice for building such systems.
