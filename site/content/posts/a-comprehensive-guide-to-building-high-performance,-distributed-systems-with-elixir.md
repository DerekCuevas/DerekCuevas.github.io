Have you ever wanted to build a highly scalable, fault-tolerant distributed system? Elixir, a functional programming language built on top of the Erlang Virtual Machine, is the perfect choice. Elixir allows for concurrent processing and has built-in support for distributed systems, making it an excellent candidate for building distributed applications.

In this post, we will guide you through building a high-performance distributed system with Elixir. We'll start by discussing the fundamental concepts behind distributed systems and then move on to explore important Elixir libraries and features like OTP and GenServer, which are essential for building fault-tolerant distributed systems.

## Understanding Distributed Systems

A distributed system is a group of independent computers that collectively work together to achieve a common goal. Each computer, also called a node, works independently and is connected using a network. A distributed system design allows for better scalability, reliability, and fault tolerance. A distributed system architecture distributes the workload over multiple machines to maximize performance and minimize the risk of failure.

Elixir makes it easy to write distributed systems using its built-in libraries. Let's now dive into some of the features and libraries that Elixir offers to build distributed systems.

## OTP and GenServer

OTP stands for “Open Telecom Platform,” and it is a programming library used to build fault-tolerant and distributed applications. Elixir offers a robust implementation of OTP. This library provides a set of abstractions on top of Erlang that help you write concurrent and fail-safe systems.

GenServer is a behavior provided by OTP that enables the creation of a server process. GenServer can handle requests from other processes, manipulate state, and send messages to other GenServers processes.

## Building Our Distributed System

To build our distributed system, we will need three components: a service discovery mechanism, a load balancing mechanism, and a fault tolerance mechanism.

For service Discovery, we will use the HashRing library. This library enables us to define a virtual ring where each node has an associated range. This ring can be used for load balancing, sharding, and service discovery.

For load balancing, we will use the RoundRobin library. This library gives us a mechanism to balance the load between different nodes in our distributed system and avoid an overload of requests on a single node.

For fault tolerance, we will use the Supervisor library. This library is essential for building highly fault-tolerant systems, as it can monitor child processes and restart them if they crash.

## Conclusion

Building a high-performance distributed system can be challenging, but Elixir offers all the necessary tools to accomplish this task easily. By using Elixir's built-in OTP and GenServer libraries, together with community-supported libraries like HashRing, RoundRobin, and Supervisor, we can build fault-tolerant distributed systems that can scale to meet our needs.

With Elixir, building a distributed system does not have to be a daunting task. Give it a try and see how easy it is to build a highly available and scalable distributed system.
