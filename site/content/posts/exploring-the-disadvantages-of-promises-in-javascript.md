Promises came to the world of JavaScript as a powerful tool to mitigate the callback hell problem and to simplify the overall way to handle asynchronous programming. However, promises are not a silver bullet and using them could introduce some drawbacks into your code. In this post, we'll explore some of the disadvantages of using promises.

## A Brief Reminder of How Promises Work

Before going deep into the downsides of promises, let's take a brief look at how a promise works:

```javascript
fetch('/users')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error))
```

In this example, we send a request to a server using the `fetch()` function. The `fetch()` function returns a promise which allows us to chain the `then()` methods. The idea of the promise is that we obtain the response asynchronously from the server, but the promise allows us to deal with the response synchronously by chaining `then()` methods. In summary, the `then()` method is called when the promise is resolved with a value, and the `catch()` method is called when the promise is rejected with an error.

## Disadvantages of Promises

### Overcomplication

Although promises were introduced to solve the callback hell problem, they are not always simpler than callbacks. In some cases, converting a callback-based function to a promise-based one could lead to more overcomplicated code. For instance, suppose we have a simple function that reads a file and calls a callback when it finishes:

```javascript
function readFile(path, callback) {
  fs.readFile(path, 'utf-8', (error, text) => {
    if (error) return callback(error)
    callback(null, text)
  })
}
```

Now, let's rewrite the same function using a promise to see what happens:

```javascript
function readFile(path) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    fs.readFile(path, 'utf-8', (error, text) => {
      if (error) return reject(error)
      resolve(text)
    })
  })
}
```

The code looks longer and more complex than the callback-based version. This overcomplication does not always make sense and could make the code harder to read and understand.

### Error Handling

Error handling with promises is not as straightforward as it is with synchronous code or even with callbacks. In traditional error handling, the errors propagate up through the call stack until they are caught by a try-catch block. Promises, on the other hand, require a `.catch()` clause to handle rejected promises. Not having a catch block could lead to unhandled promise rejections, which could cause your program to crash.

```javascript
fetch('/users')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
```

In this example, we forgot to include a `.catch()` block to handle potential errors. If the server responds with a 500 status or there is a network connection problem, an unhandled promise rejection will occur, and the program will crash.

### Debugging

Debugging asynchronous code is already challenging. Debugging promises can become even more difficult since they are not executed immediately, but at a later point in the program's execution. This can add extra complexity to debugging because stack traces may not be accurate, and it may require some extra steps to trace the execution flow.

### Lack of Cancellation

One of the most significant limitations of promises in JavaScript is the lack of built-in cancellation. If you have a long-running promise, there is no way to cancel it once it's started. You can only hope that the promise resolves or rejects itself eventually. This could cause problems if you have a system where you need to cancel promises frequently.

## Conclusion

Promises have undoubtedly been a game-changer in JavaScript world by providing a simpler way to handle asynchronous programming. However, they are not a silver bullet, and they introduce some disadvantages into our code. The next time you think about using promises, make sure you understand the downsides to make an informed decision.
