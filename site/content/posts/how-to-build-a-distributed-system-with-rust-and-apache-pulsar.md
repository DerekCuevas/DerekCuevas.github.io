Distributed systems are becoming increasingly popular for building highly available and fault-tolerant applications. Rust, with its excellent performance and memory safety, is a great language choice for building such systems. In this tutorial, we will build a distributed system with Rust and Apache Pulsar.

## What is Apache Pulsar?
Apache Pulsar is a distributed messaging and streaming platform that provides a unified messaging model and a variety of APIs, such as pub-sub and queue semantics. It offers many features out of the box, including geo-replication, multi-tenancy, and guaranteed message delivery.

## Prerequisites
- Rust 1.40.0 or later
- Apache Pulsar 2.8.0 or later

## Setting Up
First, we will create a new Rust project and add the required dependencies:

```rust
[dependencies]
pulsar-client = "0.42.0"
```

Next, we need to start up Pulsar. We can do this easily using Docker:
```bash
docker run -it \
  -p 6650:6650 \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  apachepulsar/pulsar:latest \
  bin/pulsar standalone
```

## Building a Producer
Now that we have set up Pulsar, let's build a producer that publishes messages to a topic. We will first create a `main` function that creates a Pulsar client and produces a message to a topic:
```rust
use pulsar_client::{producer::*, Pulsar, TokioExecutor};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:6650";
    let pulsar: Pulsar<TokioExecutor> = Pulsar::builder(addr, TokioExecutor)
        .build()
        .await?;
    let producer: Producer<TokioExecutor> = pulsar
        .producer()
        .with_topic("test-topic")
        .build()
        .await?;
    producer.send("hello, pulsar!".as_bytes()).await?;
    Ok(())
}
```

## Building a Consumer
Now, let's build a consumer that consumes messages from a topic. We will use the `async-stream` feature of the `pulsar-client` crate to consume messages continuously:
```rust
use pulsar_client::{consumer::*, ConsumerConfig, Pulsar, TokioExecutor};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let addr = "127.0.0.1:6650";
    let pulsar: Pulsar<TokioExecutor> = Pulsar::builder(addr, TokioExecutor)
        .build()
        .await?;
    let consumer: Consumer<TokioExecutor> = pulsar
        .consumer()
        .with_topic("test-topic")
        .with_consumer_name("test-consumer")
        .with_consumer_config(ConsumerConfig {
            subscription_mode: SubscriptionMode::Exclusive,
            ..Default::default()
        })
        .build()
        .await?;
    let mut messages = consumer.stream().await?;
    while let Some(msg) = messages.next().await {
        println!("Received message: {:?}", msg.payload());
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

## Conclusion
In this tutorial, we have learned how to build a distributed system with Rust and Apache Pulsar. We built a producer that publishes messages to a topic and a consumer that consumes messages continuously. You can modify and extend this code to build other types of distributed systems, such as stream processing systems and event-driven architectures. Happy coding!
