# Introduction


Experimental usage of various high performance computing elements are often seen in Rust due to its focus on zero-cost abstractions, memory safety, and concurrency. Thread affinity is an important concept in high performance computing and can greatly improve the performance and efficiency of a program. In this post, we will be using `rust-affinity`, a library that provides support for setting the processor affinity of a thread in Rust.


# Understanding Processor Affinity

Processor or CPU Affinity is the assignment of a process or a thread to a given set of CPUs in the multiprocessing operating systems. The aim is to reduce the overhead involved while switching tasks and maintaining locality of references in cache and memory.

Setting the CPU affinity could be beneficial for real-time or high performance computing applications where context switching leads to unwanted overhead.


# Using the `rust-affinity` Crate

Rust provides a crate named `rust-affinity` which supports setting the processor affinity of a thread. You can add it to your project by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rust-affinity = "0.5"
```

Now let’s create a new thread and pin it to a specific CPU.

```rust
extern crate rust_affinity;

use rust_affinity::*;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let t = thread::spawn(|| {
        let cpus = get_affinity(get_tid()).unwrap();
        println!("{:?}", cpus);
    });
    
    let handle = t.thread().native_id();
    set_affinity(handle, vec![0]).unwrap();

    t.join().unwrap();
}
```

Here we create a thread using `spawn()`, and find the thread id using `native_id()`. Then we pin this thread to CPU 0 using `set_affinity()`.


# Conclusion

In conclusion, incorporating processor affinity into your high performance computing programs can greatly increase their efficiency by reducing context-switching and improving the locality of data. Although it may seem a bit complex at first, libraries like `rust-affinity` make managing processor affinity in Rust quite straightforward. Just remember to use this tool judiciously, as incorrectly setting processor affinity can degrade performance rather than improve it.

Always monitor the results of these changes to ensure they truly improve your program’s performance.
