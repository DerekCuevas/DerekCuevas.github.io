Functional programming is becoming increasingly popular in recent years due to its declarative nature and improved readability. One of the key concepts in functional programming is the use of higher order functions. Higher order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments and/or return functions as their result. They are one of the main building blocks for creating reusable and composable code. In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of higher order functions in TypeScript.

## Defining Higher Order Functions

As stated earlier, a higher order function is any function that takes at least one function as an argument or returns a function as its result. This definition is broad and can encompass a wide range of functions. Here is a simple example of a higher order function:

```typescript
function applyOperation(a: number, b: number, operation: (a: number, b: number) => number): number {
    return operation(a, b);
}
```

In this example, `applyOperation` takes a function `operation` as its third argument and applies it to `a` and `b`. `operation` is a callback function that expects two arguments of type `number` and returns a value of type `number`. The `applyOperation` function is an example of a higher order function as it takes another function as its argument.

Here is an example of a function that returns a new function:

```typescript
function createMultiplier(factor: number): (n: number) => number {
    return function(n: number): number {
        return n * factor;
    }
}
```

In this example, `createMultiplier` takes an argument `factor` and returns a new function that takes an argument of type `number` and returns a value of type `number`. The returned function multiplies its argument by the `factor`. This function is another example of a higher order function as it returns a function.

## Benefits of Higher Order Functions

The use of higher order functions provides a number of benefits. Here are a few of them:

- Reusability: Higher order functions can be used to create reusable and modular code. They allow us to extract common patterns into separate functions that can be reused across multiple parts of our codebase.

- Composition: Higher order functions can be composed together to form more complex and powerful functions. By composing functions, we can create custom behavior that is tailored to our specific needs.

- Abstraction: Higher order functions allow us to abstract away implementation details and work at a higher level of abstraction. This makes our code easier to reason about and can improve its readability.

## Common Higher Order Functions

There are a few higher order functions that are commonly used in functional programming. Here are a few of them:

### Map

The `map` function is used to transform each element of an array into a new value based on a given function. Here is an example of using the `map` function to square each item in an array of numbers:

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squaredNumbers = numbers.map((n: number) => n * n); // [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

### Filter

The `filter` function is used to create a new array that contains only the elements that pass a given test, based on a supplied function. Here is an example of using the `filter` function to filter out the odd numbers in an array:

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const evenNumbers = numbers.filter((n: number) => n % 2 === 0); // [2, 4]
```

### Reduce

The `reduce` function is used to reduce an array to a single value by performing a given operation on each element of the array. Here is an example of using the `reduce` function to sum the values of an array:

```typescript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((a: number, b: number) => a + b, 0); // 15
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we explored the fundamentals of higher order functions in TypeScript. We learned that higher order functions are functions that take other functions as arguments and/or return functions as their result. We also saw that higher order functions provide a number of benefits, including reusability, composition, and abstraction. Finally, we looked at some common higher order functions that are used in functional programming, such as `map`, `filter`, and `reduce`.
