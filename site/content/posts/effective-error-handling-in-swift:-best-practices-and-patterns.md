Swift has become one of the most popular programming languages for building iOS, macOS, and watchOS applications. Error handling is a critical part of writing robust, successful Swift code. It's important to have a solid understanding of the most effective error handling techniques and best practices in order to ensure your code is reliable and easy to debug.

In this post, we'll explore some of the best practices and patterns for handling errors in Swift.

## Throwing and Propagating Errors

In Swift, we can throw an error by using the `throw` keyword. This allows us to indicate to the caller of a function that something has gone wrong and we cannot run the code as intended.

```swift
enum ValidationError: Error {
    case emptyUsername
    case tooShortPassword
}

func register(username: String, password: String) throws -> Bool {
    guard !username.isEmpty else {
        throw ValidationError.emptyUsername
    }
    guard password.count >= 8 else {
        throw ValidationError.tooShortPassword
    }
    // ... implementation for successful registration
    return true
}
```

In the code above, we define an enumeration called `ValidationError` to represent the specific errors that can be thrown within our `register` function. We then check for a couple of validation errors and throw the corresponding error if any are found.

When calling `register`, the code must handle the possibility that the function throws an error. We can handle this by using a `try` statement:

```swift
do {
    let success = try register(username: "example", password: "password")
    print(success)
} catch let error {
    print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```

Here, we execute the `register` function in a `do` block, which is the general way of grouping together code that might throw an error. If an error is thrown, we catch it and handle it in the `catch` block.

However, sometimes certain errors are not expected to be handled in a certain scope of the program and we may want those errors to be propagated to the caller of the current function. In Swift, you can rethrow errors caught within a `catch` block to keep passing the error to the caller until it is ultimately handled.

```swift
func topLevelFunction() throws {
    do {
        try middleFunction()
    } catch let error {
        throw error
    }
}

func middleFunction() throws {
    do {
        try bottomFunction()
    } catch let error {
        throw error
    }
}

func bottomFunction() throws {
    throw MyError()
}
```

Here, if `bottomFunction()` throws an error, the error will be rethrown all the way to the top level function, allowing it to be handled where appropriate.

## Using Result Type

Since Swift 5, we have a new feature called `Result` which has become a standardized way to handle errors that Swift codes return. The `Result` type is an enum which has two cases: `success` and `failure` allowing us to deal with errors more explicitly rather than relying on the throwing error types.

```swift
enum HTTPError: Error {
    case unauthorized(String)
    case notFound(String)
}

func fetchData() -> Result<String, Error> {
    let success = false
    if success {
        return .success("Data successfully fetched!")
    }
    else {
        return .failure(HTTPError.notFound("Data not found"))
    }
}

let result = fetchData()

switch result {
    case .success(let data):
        print(data)
    case .failure(let error):
        print(error.localizedDescription)
}
```

Here, we define an `HTTPError` enumeration that we will use to represent errors thrown during our `fetchData()` function. Instead of using `throws` keyword, we return the `Result` type with a string to represent when data is successfully fetched, or an error instance to represent different error cases. 

## Using NSError

For interoperability with `Objective-C` or handling system defined errors, like core data errors, we have a old genre `NSError` which can be used to represent and propagate errors effectively.

```swift
let writeError = NSError(domain: "com.example.app", code: 1, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Failed to write to file."])
let readError = NSError(domain: "com.example.app", code: 2, userInfo: [NSLocalizedDescriptionKey: "Failed to read from file."])

func writeToFile() -> Error? {
    return writeError
}

func readFromFile() -> Error? {
    return readError
}

let writeResult = writeToFile()
let readResult = readFromFile()

if let error = writeResult {
    if (error as NSError).code == 1 {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}

if let error = readResult {
    if (error as NSError).code == 2 {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}
```

Here, we show an `NSError` instance being returned by `writeToFile()` and `readFromFile()` functions and later unwrapping it using Swift's error pattern matching.

## Conclusion

Error handling is an important aspect of Swift programming. By using the proper techniques and best practices, your code will be more reliable, easier to debug, and easier to maintain. In this post, we looked at some of the common patterns and functionalities for error handling like throwing and propagating errors, using `Result` type and `NSError`.

Remember, error handling is just one aspect of building high-quality Swift applications, but it's a critical one. By using these best practices and making it a priority in your code, you'll be well on your way to building successful, robust Swift applications.
