Rust's Actix-Web library is a high-performance, low-resource web development framework that allows developers to produce safe and scalable web services rapidly. With its flexible routing system and advanced content handling features, you can build ultra-fast web applications with ease. In this post, we will explore how to build high-performance web applications with Rust's Actix-Web library.

### Installation

To start off, ensure that you have Rust installed on your system. If you don't have Rust installed yet, check out the Rust website's installation guide.

Next, create a new Rust project by running the following command:

```
$ cargo new hello-world --bin
$ cd hello-world
```

Add the Actix-Web library dependency to your Cargo.toml file:

```toml
[dependencies]
actix-web = "3.3.2"
```

### Basic usage

Now we can start building a simple web server with Actix-Web. First, create a new file named `main.rs` in the root folder of your project. 

Include the following code snippet to create a server that listens on port 8080 and returns a plain text response.

```rust
use actix_web::{get, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};

#[get("/")]
async fn index() -> HttpResponse {
    HttpResponse::Ok().body("Hello, World")
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| App::new().service(index))
        .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
        .run()
        .await
}
```

### Routing

Actix-Web's routing system is very flexible. You can route to functions that return anything that implements the `Responder` trait. Additionally, you can define route parameters by including named path segments in your URL pattern. 

```rust
use actix_web::{get, web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};

#[get("/hello/{name}")]
async fn hello(web::Path(name): web::Path<String>) -> HttpResponse {
    let response_body = format!("Hello, {}", name);
    HttpResponse::Ok().body(response_body)
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| App::new().service(hello))
        .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
        .run()
        .await
}
```

In this example, the `hello` function is decorated with the `get` attribute and a parameter `{name}`. When the user navigates to `/hello/world`, Actix-Web will extract the value `world` and pass it as an argument to the `hello` function.

### Error Handling

Handling errors properly is crucial to the long-term maintainability and performance of a web service. Fortunately, Actix-Web provides powerful error handling out-of-the-box.

One way to handle errors is to define a custom error type for your application, implement the `Responde` trait, then return it from each of your route handlers.

```rust
use actix_web::{error, get, http::StatusCode, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};
use std::borrow::Cow;

#[derive(Debug)]
enum CustomError {
    InternalServerError,
    BadRequest,
}

impl actix_web::ResponseError for CustomError {
    fn status_code(&self) -> StatusCode {
        match self {
            CustomError::InternalServerError => StatusCode::INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR,
            CustomError::BadRequest => StatusCode::BAD_REQUEST,
        }
    }

    fn error_response(&self) -> HttpResponse {
        let error_message = match self {
            CustomError::InternalServerError => "Internal Server Error",
            CustomError::BadRequest => "Bad Request",
        };

        HttpResponse::new(self.status_code()).body(error_message.to_string())
    }
}

#[get("/")]
async fn index() -> Result<&'static str, CustomError> {
    Err(CustomError::InternalServerError)
}

#[get("/bad")]
async fn bad_path() -> Result<&'static str, CustomError> {
    Err(CustomError::BadRequest)
}

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    HttpServer::new(|| App::new().service(index).service(bad_path))
        .bind("127.0.0.1:8080")?
        .run()
        .await
}
```
The `CustomError` type here is just an example. In practice, you'll want to create a custom error type that better suits your use case.
