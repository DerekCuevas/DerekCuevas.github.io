Have you ever wanted to build a complex, high throughput, and highly available application? A distributed system might just be what you are looking for. In today's world, where companies are expected to deliver their software applications to thousands of users spread across different geographies, it is no longer an option to have a single machine running the entire application. This post will provide an in-depth guide to distributed systems, covering everything from patterns to best practices.

## Introduction

A distributed system is composed of multiple autonomous components that collaborate together to provide a unified service or application. One of the essential features of a distributed system is the ability to run in parallel across a cluster of machines. The primary goal of a distributed system is to provide fault tolerance, load balancing, and scalability.

## Distributed System Patterns

### Master-Slave Pattern

In this pattern, a single master node distributes workloads to a collection of worker nodes. The master is responsible for assigning and tracking workloads, while the worker nodes are responsible for executing the assigned work. The advantages of this pattern are that it is simple to implement with low overhead, and the workloads can be distributed across a cluster of machines, allowing for the parallel execution of tasks.

### Peer-to-Peer Pattern

In this pattern, the nodes are both producers and consumers of data. Each node is equally responsible for processing data and forwarding it to other nodes in the network. The main advantage of this pattern is that it has no central point of failure, making it highly resilient.

### Publish-Subscribe Pattern

The Publish-Subscribe pattern is a simple and flexible way of distributing notifications across a group of subscribers. In this pattern, publishers send messages to a broker, which then forwards those messages to subscribed consumers. A significant advantage of this pattern is that it allows for decoupling between the publisher and subscribers, making it easy to scale the system.

## Distributed System Best Practices

### Use a Service Mesh

As the complexity of your application grows, the management of networking between components becomes increasingly difficult. A service mesh is a dedicated infrastructure layer is designed to handle the communication logic between distributed application infrastructure services. It provides functionalities such as traffic routing, service discovery, load balancing, observability, security, and a host of other features. It simplifies communication among services and frees up application code to focus on business logic.

### Use Async Communication

Asynchronous communication is essential in distributed systems because it enables nodes to continue operating even when one or more other nodes are down or experiencing delays. With asynchronous communication, requests are sent and received without waiting for a response. The requestor then continues processing while the response arrives at a later time.

### Use Eventual Consistency

When working with distributed systems, it is essential to have the notion of eventual consistency, meaning that the system will eventually reach a consistent state, even if individual nodes may have different data views at any point in time. Implementing eventual consistency requires careful design, and trade-offs must be made between data availability, data integrity, and system performance.

## Conclusion

In this post, we have explored key patterns and best practices for building distributed systems. Distributed systems can be challenging, but they are also incredibly powerful. When designed and implemented correctly, they can provide exceptional scalability, fault-tolerance, and availability. By following best practices and patterns such as master-slave, peer-to-peer, publish-subscribe, using a service mesh, Async communication, Eventual Consistency, you can build systems that can handle large amounts of data, traffic, and users.
