Building distributed systems that can handle massive workloads and data loads requires the proper tools and technologies. Apache Kafka is one of the most popular distributed streaming platforms for handling these requirements, with the ability to scale horizontally and process millions of events per second. In this post, we will explore how to build highly scalable distributed systems using Rust and Apache Kafka.

## Introduction

Rust is a highly performant and memory-safe language that is great for building systems-level programs. Rust has become increasingly popular for building high-concurrency and low-latency network applications. Apache Kafka is a popular distributed streaming platform that is built for scalability, fault-tolerance, and high-throughput data processing. Together, Rust and Kafka provide a powerful combination for building massively-scalable distributed systems.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with this tutorial, you should have:

- A working knowledge of Rust programming language.
- A basic understanding of Apache Kafka.

## Setting Up a Rust Project with Kafka

The first step to building a Kafka producer in Rust is to add the `rdrkafka` and `serde` crates to your project's `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rdkafka = "0.21.0"
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0.64"
```

The `rdkafka` crate provides Rust bindings for the Kafka client library, and the `serde` and `serde_json` crates will be used to serialize and deserialize data that we send through Kafka.

## Creating a Kafka Producer

Next, we'll create a new Rust module for our Kafka producer:

```rust
use rdkafka::config::ClientConfig;
use rdkafka::producer::{FutureProducer, FutureRecord};
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Message {
    topic: String,
    value: String,
}

pub async fn produce(message: Message) {
    let broker = "localhost:9092";
    let producer: &FutureProducer = &ClientConfig::new()
        .set("bootstrap.servers", broker)
        .set("max.in.flight", "1")
        .create().unwrap();

    let record = FutureRecord::to(&message.topic)
        .key("")
        .payload(&message.value);

    match producer.send(record, 10000).await {
        Ok(_) => println!("message sent"),
        Err(e) => println!("error sending message: {:?}", e)
    };
}
```

In this code, we're defining a `Message` struct that encapsulates a Kafka topic and message payload. We're also creating an `async` function called `produce` that takes in a `Message` as an argument. Inside this function, we create a new Kafka producer and then use it to send the provided message to Kafka.

## Creating a Kafka Consumer

Next, we'll create a Rust module for our Kafka consumer:

```rust
use itertools::Itertools;
use rdkafka::config::ClientConfig;
use rdkafka::consumer::{Consumer, StreamConsumer, ConsumerConfig};
use rdkafka::message::Message as KafkaMessage;
use tokio::stream::StreamExt;

pub fn consume(topic: &str) {
    let broker = "localhost:9092";
    let consumer: StreamConsumer =
        ClientConfig::new()
            .set("bootstrap.servers", broker)
            .set("group.id", "example-group")
            .set("session.timeout.ms", "6000")
            .set("enable.auto.commit", "false")
            .create()
            .unwrap();

    consumer.subscribe(&[topic]).unwrap();

    let stream = consumer.stream();

    let future = stream.for_each(|result| {
        match result {
            Ok(kafka_message) => {
                println!(
                    "received message: {:?}",
                    kafka_message.payload().iter().map(|&x| x as char).collect::<String>()
                )
            },
            Err(e) => println!("error receiving message: {:?}", e),
        }
        Ok(())
    });

    tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()
        .unwrap()
        .block_on(future)
        .unwrap();
}
```

In this code, we're defining a `consume` function that takes in a Kafka topic as an argument. We're creating a Kafka consumer and subscribing it to the provided topic. We're then using Tokio to create a stream of Kafka messages that we will consume. For each message, we're deserializing the payload and printing it to the console.

## Conclusion

In this post, we explored how to build highly scalable distributed systems with Rust and Apache Kafka. We went through the steps to create a producer and consumer for Kafka messages in Rust, allowing us to connect Rust applications to a Kafka cluster. Building distributed systems with Rust and Kafka can lead to highly performant and fault-tolerant architectures that are capable of processing massive workloads.
