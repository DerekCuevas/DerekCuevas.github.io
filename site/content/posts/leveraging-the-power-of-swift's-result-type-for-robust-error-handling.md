## Introduction

In Swift, error handling is an important aspect of writing safe and robust code. The language gives us several tools to deal with errors effectively. One of these is the `Result` type, introduced in Swift 5.0. In this post, we will explore how to use the `Result` type effectively to handle success and failure cases in our Swift code.

## Understanding the Result Type

Before we dive into an example, let's understand the `Result` type itself. The `Result` type is a simple enumeration with two cases: `.success` and `.failure`, each one carries associated values depending on whether they represent a success or a failure. Here is how it looks:

```swift
enum Result<Success, Failure: Error> {
    case success(Success)
    case failure(Failure)
}
```

The `Result` type is a powerful way to model the success or failure of some task in your code.

## Using the Result Type

Let's take a look at an example. We will create a function that simulates fetching a user from the network. This function could either fail (for example, if there's no internet connection), or succeed (if it was able to fetch the user details correctly).

```swift
enum NetworkError: Error {
    case disconnected
}

struct User {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
}
    
func fetchUser(id: Int, completion: @escaping (Result<User, NetworkError>) -> Void) {
    // Simulate a network request
    DispatchQueue.global().asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 2) {
        if Bool.random() {
            let user = User(id: id, name: "John Doe")
            completion(.success(user))
        } else {
            completion(.failure(.disconnected))
        }
    }
}
```

In the above code, we are passing a completion handler to the `fetchUser(id:completion:)` function which takes a `Result` type. In the `Result` enumeration, `User` is our success case and `NetworkError` is our failure case.

## Handling the Result

Now that we have a `Result` type, we have a clear and elegant way to handle both our success and error case. Look at how we can handle the response:

```swift
fetchUser(id: 1) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let user):
        print("Fetched user: \(user)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Failed to fetch user with error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

In the event of success, we access the associated `User` value, and in the event of failure, we get our `NetworkError` type that we can handle appropriately.

## Conclusion

Swift's `Result` type provides an elegant way to handle success and failure cases of a function in a type-safe manner. It brings clarity to our code and makes our error handling code much simpler. Give it a try in your next project!
