## Introduction

One of the core principles in Rust's design is ensuring safety through static, compile-time checks, particularly with mutable references. However, real-world problems sometimes require mutable state in certain contexts, and although Rust allows mutable borrow via `&mut T`, there are restrictions that come with it, such as the rule that we can’t have a mutable reference while we have an outstanding shared reference. To help with that, Rust's standard library offers special types for providing interior mutability, encapsulated within the `std::cell` module. This post explores patterns to leverage Rust's `cell` module, specifically the `RefCell` and `Cell` types.

## Cell & RefCell

The `std::cell::Cell` and `std::cell::RefCell` types represent single ownership over the data they contain, giving ability to mutate the value they contain, even when the type is not marked as mutable. 

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;

let x = Cell::new(1);
let y = &x;
let z = &x;
x.set(2);
println!("{}", x.get()); // prints: 2
```

In this code snippet, `x` can be updated even though `y` and `z` are referring to it. 

`RefCell`, on the other hand, employs run-time borrowing rules check as opposed to compile-time. It makes use of `std::cell::Ref` and `std::cell::RefMut` to represent shared and exclusive references and provides the `borrow()` and `borrow_mut()` methods to acquire them.

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

let x = RefCell::new(vec![1, 2, 3, 4]);
{
    println!("{:?}", *x.borrow()); // prints: [1, 2, 3, 4]

    let mut y = x.borrow_mut();
    y.push(5);
}
println!("{:?}", *x.borrow()); // prints: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

In this snippet, `x` is first borrowed immutably, then mutably within a different scope, allowing list modification.

## When to use Cell & RefCell

`std::cell::Cell` is used when we want to alter some internal state that isn't visible from outside the type. 

`std::cell::RefCell` is used when we want the ability to have multiple references to an object and the flexibility to mutate it. 

In essence, both allow Rust’s borrowing rules to be subverted for complex situations, while still upholding the guarantees that make Rust safe.

## Conclusion

By exploring the `std::cell` module, specifically the `Cell` and `RefCell` types, we've seen how Rust provides mechanisms to manage mutable state while still adhering to principles of safety. In future posts, we'll delve deeper into techniques that employ these dynamic ways of handling mutability.
