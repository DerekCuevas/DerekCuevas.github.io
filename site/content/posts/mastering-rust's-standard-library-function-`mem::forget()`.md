When writing low-level systems programming in Rust, you'll often find yourself working with raw pointers, and as such, managing memory yourself. Rust's ownership and borrowing model does an excellent job at preventing common issues like null references or dangling pointers, but there are times when you need to circumvent the system and borrow or manage memory in unsafe ways.

In this post, we'll talk about one such dangerous function in Rust's standard library called `mem::forget()`. We'll discuss what it does, when you should use it, and most importantly, when you shouldn't.

## What is `mem::forget()`?

Rust's `mem::forget()` function is a way to “forget” about a value without actually dropping it. By calling `mem::forget()` on a value, you're telling Rust to ignore its lifetime, prevent it from being dropped, and stop tracking it. This function is unsafe because it can cause a memory leak or undefined behavior if used incorrectly.

Here's an example to illustrate `mem::forget()`:

```rust
use std::mem;

fn main() {
    let value = Box::new("Hello, world!");
    let ptr = Box::into_raw(value);

    // ptr is now a raw pointer containing the memory address of "Hello, world!"
    // Do something with ptr...

    unsafe {
        // We're done with ptr, so we'll call forget to prevent the box from being dropped.
        mem::forget(ptr);
    }
}
```

As you can see, `mem::forget()` is called with the raw pointer `ptr`. The `Box::into_raw()` function converts the box value into a raw pointer, transferring ownership to the raw pointer. Once `mem::forget()` is called on the raw pointer, Rust will not try to deallocate the memory on the heap when `ptr` goes out of scope.

## When should you use `mem::forget()`?

In general, you should be very cautious when using `mem::forget()`. The function's purpose is to tell Rust to stop tracking a value and not deallocate its memory when it goes out of scope. If you're not careful, calling `mem::forget()` can create memory leaks, use-after-free errors, and other undefined behavior.

That being said, there are some specific situations where `mem::forget()` can be useful:

- When working with FFI or external libraries that require raw pointers.
- When implementing a data structure with custom deallocating behavior.
- When using an object pool or other data structure that manages its memory manually.

For instance, suppose you're writing an FFI call to a C library that returns a string pointer, like so:

```rust
fn c_func() -> *mut c_char {
    let c_string = CString::new("Hello, world!").unwrap();
    c_string.into_raw()
}
```

This function returns a raw pointer to the string data allocated on the heap. If you call `mem::forget()` on the pointer, Rust will not drop the value automatically, and the memory behind the pointer will be left untouched. In this case, the C library or another function that uses the pointer could be responsible for deallocating the memory when it's no longer needed.

## When should you not use `mem::forget()`?

`mem::forget()` is a very dangerous function that can cause a wide range of unexpected issues. It should only be used as a last resort and with extreme care.

Here are some situations where you should avoid using `mem::forget()`:

- When you're not working with raw pointer APIs or external libraries that require them.
- When there are safe alternatives available that you can use instead.
- When you're dealing with a value that needs to run its destructor.

In most cases, you should let Rust's ownership and lifetime system handle deallocating memory automatically. Rust provides a powerful set of tools (such as `Box`, `Arc`, and `Rc`) for managing memory in a safe manner. If you can use these tools, you should avoid using `mem::forget()` altogether.

Here's an example of when using `mem::forget()` is a terrible idea:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = "Hello, world!".to_string();

    let ptr = s.as_ptr();
    let len = s.len();

    // Oops, we forgot to call drop() on s!

    unsafe {
        // We'll call forget to prevent the string from being dropped.
        mem::forget(s);
    }

    // This code continues to use the pointer 'ptr'
    // and the length 'len' to read from the memory that s occupied
    // expect some undefined behavior here 
}
```

In this example, we've used `mem::forget()` to ignore the lifetime of `s`, effectively preventing Rust from calling the `String`'s destructor and freeing its memory. This code is very dangerous because it is undefined behavior to continue using the pointer and length of a string after it has been dropped. Don't use `mem::forget()` in situations like this.

## Conclusion

`mem::forget()` is a function that can be very powerful or very dangerous, depending on how you use it. While it's true that there are situations where `mem::forget()` can come in handy, you should always be wary of its potential pitfalls. As always, make sure you understand what you're doing and test your code comprehensively to ensure that you're not shooting yourself in the foot.
