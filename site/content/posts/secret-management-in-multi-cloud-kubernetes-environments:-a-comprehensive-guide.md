As Kubernetes is adopted more widely, secret management has become a more complicated process. Enterprises who use multiple cloud providers, or a combination of cloud and on-premises resources, must take additional steps to secure secrets across a range of deployments. In this post, we will discuss secrets management in multi-cloud Kubernetes environments, reviewing the current landscape and best practices, and exploring strategies for secure secret storage and management.

## Introduction

Before going deeper into secrets management on Kubernetes, let's review some basic concepts. A "secret" is a piece of sensitive data that needs to be stored securely and may include information such as passwords, tokens, or keys used by applications. Kubernetes offers two different types of secrets: "Opaque" and "TLS". Opaque secrets represent arbitrary data, without requiring any specific structure, while TLS secrets are used to store X.509 certificates and related private keys.

When Kubernetes creates a pod, it can be supplied with one or more secrets. Pods can use multiple secrets simultaneously, as each one is mounted as a directory/file in the container's file system. In this way, secrets can be securely consumed by applications running on Kubernetes.

## Secret Management Challenges in Kubernetes Environments

The main challenge of secret management in Kubernetes is to make sensitive data available only to the containers or pods that need it. But there are some other difficulties to face in multi-cloud or hybrid environments. Let's list some of them:

1. Secrets need to be replicated across all clusters.
2. Secret access control policies must be enforced across all environments.
3. Versioning and synchronization of secrets must be considered.
4. Secrets must be encrypted both in transit and at rest.

These challenges represent opportunities for attackers to exploit some vulnerabilities and damage cloud-native applications. Therefore, it is crucial to have an effective security plan to mitigate possible risks.

## Secrets Encryption

In Kubernetes, secrets are stored in the `etcd` key-value store. As a consequence, secret encryption is not a built-in feature of Kubernetes. To address this challenge, a number of encryption strategies can be followed to safeguard sensitive data.

One effective strategy is envelope encryption, which is used extensively by the industry. In envelope encryption, first, a single symmetric key is generated to encrypt and decrypt the secret data. Then, a "data encryption key" or DEK is randomly generated to encrypt the symmetric key. Finally, the encrypted symmetric key is stored along with the encrypted secrets. In this way, different keys are used to encrypt each secret, complicating potential attacks.

Here is an example of how to use OpenSSL to encrypt secret data:

```bash
$ echo -n "secret value" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -pass pass:mysecret -base64
```

## Secret Management Best Practices

Here are some best practices for secret management on Kubernetes:

### Audit Secrets Regularly

Auditing is an important aspect of Kubernetes security. Regular audits of secrets, will ensure that all secrets are still valid and in use, and that only authorized users have access.

To accomplish this, consider using a secrets management solution that provides the ability to detect secret usage. [CloudKnox](https://cloudknox.io/) and [Conjur](https://www.conjur.org/) are examples of such solutions.

### Use Kubernetes Built-In Secrets Storage
Kubernetes allows secrets to be stored and mounted inside a pod as volumes, providing direct access to the secrets. This reduces the risk of exploitation of the attack surface.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: mysecret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: base64 encoded user
  password: base64 encoded password
```

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: myapp
    image: myapp:v1
    env:
    - name: DB_USERNAME
      valueFrom:
         secretKeyRef:
           name: mysecret
           key: username
    - name: DB_PASSWORD
      valueFrom:
        secretKeyRef:
           name: mysecret
           key: password
```

### Use Fine-Grained Control Access

An important practice to secure secrets is to implement fine-grained access control. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), for example, is a Kubernetes mechanism used to control who has access to what resources and what operations they are allowed to perform on those resources. 

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: mynamespace
  name: secret-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["secrets"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
``` 

### Store Secrets in an External Solution

Storing secrets in an external secret store, like [HashiCorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), can help mitigate risks and enhance the security of the secrets. Vault provides a centralized and secure repository for storing and managing secrets.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: vaultsecret
  annotations:
    "vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject": "true"
    "vault.hashicorp.com/agent-inject-secret-foo": "myapp/creds"
    "vault.hashicorp.com/role": "my-object-role"
type: Opaque
data:
  username: base64 encoded username
  password: base64 encoded password
```

## Conclusion

Secret management in multi-cloud Kubernetes environments needs to be a priority for enterprises to ensure that sensitive application data is thoroughly protected. Although Kubernetes provides some basic features to manage secrets, additional steps must be taken to manage secrets securely in multi-cloud environments. As we have seen, encryption, auditing, access control, and external secret stores are valuable techniques for enhancing secrets management in Kubernetes.
