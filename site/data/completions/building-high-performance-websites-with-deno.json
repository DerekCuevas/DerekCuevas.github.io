     "content": "Title: Building High-Performance Websites with Deno\n\nTags: Deno, TypeScript, Rust\n\nDeno is a modern JavaScript and TypeScript runtime built using Rust. It is designed to be secure, performant, and maintainable. Deno is built with the latest web technologies and has a focus on server-side development. In this article, we will explore how to build high-performance websites using Deno.\n\n## Installing Deno\n\nBefore we start, let's make sure we have Deno installed on our machine. We can easily do this with the help of `curl` or `powershell`:\n\n```bash\ncurl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh\n\n# or\n\niwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex\n```\n\nAfter Deno is installed, we can check its version using the following command:\n\n```bash\ndeno --version\n```\n\nThis should print out the current version of Deno that you have installed on your machine.\n\n## Building a Server\n\nLet's start by building a server that will serve our website. First, create an empty file `server.ts` and add the following code:\n\n```typescript\nimport { serve } from \"https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts\";\n\nconst server = serve({ port: 8000 });\n\nfor await (const request of server) {\n  request.respond({ body: \"Hello World\\n\" });\n}\n```\n\nWe are importing the `serve` function from the `http/server` module from the standard library and creating a new server that listens on port `8000`. When a request is made to the server, we respond with a \"Hello World\" message.\n\nTo start the server, run the following command:\n\n```bash\ndeno run --allow-net server.ts\n```\n\nThis will start the server which will respond to all incoming requests on port `8000`.\n\n## Serving Static Files\n\nNow let's serve some static files. We can use the `serveStatic` function from the `https://deno.land/x/serve` module to serve static files from the `public` folder.\n\nCreate a `public` folder in the same directory as the `server.ts` file with an `index.html` file that has some simple HTML:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Hello World</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Hello World</h1>\n    <p>This page was served from Deno.</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n```\n\nThen add the following code to our `server.ts` file:\n\n```typescript\nimport { serve } from \"https://deno.land/std/http/server.ts\";\nimport { serveStatic } from \"https://deno.land/x/serve/mod.ts\";\n\nconst server = serve({ port: 8000 });\nconst staticServer = serveStatic(\".\", { index: \"index.html\" });\n\nfor await (const request of server) {\n  const result = await staticServer(request);\n  if (result) {\n    request.respond(result);\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `serveStatic` function is used to create a static file server that will serve files from the current directory. We are providing an `index` option with the value of `\"index.html\"`, which specifies that when a directory is requested, `index.html` should be served.\n\n## Adding TypeScript to Deno\n\nDeno comes with first-class support for TypeScript. You can use TypeScript in your Deno projects by simply using `.ts` files instead of `.js` files. To use TypeScript with Deno, you don't need any additional setup.\n\nLet's add a simple TypeScript file `main.ts` that uses a third-party package `lodash`:\n\n```typescript\nimport * as _ from \"https://deno.land/x/lodash/mod.ts\";\n\nconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\nconst evens = _.filter(numbers, (n) => n % 2 === 0);\n\nconsole.log(evens);\n```\n\nWe are using the `filter` method from `lodash` to get all even numbers from an array of numbers.\n\nTo run this file, use the following command:\n\n```bash\ndeno run --allow-net main.ts\n```\n\nDeno will automatically download the `lodash` package and cache it. If you run the same command again, it will use the cached version.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this article, we explored how to build high-performance websites using Deno. We learned how to create a server and serve static files using Deno's standard library. We also learned how to use TypeScript with Deno and how to use third-party packages. Deno's focus on security, performance, and maintainability makes it an excellent choice for building powerful and scalable web applications."
