     "content": "How to Build a Realtime Collaborative Spreadsheet Application with Elixir and Phoenix LiveView\n\nTags: Elixir, Phoenix LiveView, Realtime Systems\n\nAs web applications become increasingly interactive, handling real-time updates and non-blocking input/output has become a crucial aspect of web development. Elixir, a functional programming language built on top of the Erlang virtual machine, and the Phoenix web framework provide developers with a powerful toolset to build scalable, fault-tolerant, and high-performance web applications able to handle thousands of concurrent connections and chatrooms, vote systems, realtime games, message queues and any system where is near impossible or highly cumbersome to perform full reloads for each user update.\n\nIn this post, we will demonstrate how to leverage Elixir and Phoenix LiveView to build a real-time collaborative spreadsheet application. First, we will discuss the background and theory behind Elixir and Phoenix LiveView, including how LiveView works under the hood to provide real-time features. Then, we will explore how to use LiveView in practice, building a basic spreadsheet application using Phoenix and Elixir.\n\n## Background\n\nElixir is a functional programming language that is designed for performant, scalable, fault-tolerant systems. Elixir takes advantage of Erlang's virtual machine and programming model to provide a platform for building distributed systems. Elixir syntax is similar to Ruby, making it an approachable language to learn, and provides excellent documentation for developers of all skill levels. \n\nPhoenix is a web framework for Elixir that uses the same principles as Elixir to provide fault-tolerance and scalability to web applications. Phoenix provides tools for handling many concurrent connections, websockets, authentication, and many other features that make it a formidable competitor in the web development space. Phoenix LiveView is a real-time feature for Phoenix that came out in 2019. LiveView takes Elixir's concurrency features and combines them with a reactive programming model to provide an easy way to build real-time features.\n\n## Working with Phoenix LiveView\n\nPhoenix LiveView offers developers the ability to build real-time web applications without the need to write any client-side JavaScript code. Instead of using JavaScript, LiveView leverages the power of Elixir and a reactive programming model to provide real-time updates to the DOM. \n\nAs you know, HTML is a static format, and changes can only be made to the DOM by manipulating its underlying JavaScript representation, the Document Object Model. DOM manipulation in JavaScript is a low-level, highly manual task that can be very error-prone and hard to debug. LiveView eliminates the need for manual DOM manipulation. \n\nLiveView operates by sending a payload of predetermined data from the server to the client, and then manipulating the DOM based on the data received. Through the use of a dedicated connection, LiveView sends and receives messages from the server that update the data model and, consequently, the page's rendering.\n\n## Building a Realtime Collaborative Spreadsheet Application\n\nFor our sample application, we will create a basic spreadsheet with some real-time collaboration features. Several users will be able to view and edit the spreadsheet simultaneously, and any changes made by one user are immediately reflected in all of the other users' views.\n\nFirst, let's create the Phoenix application.\n\nWe will assume basic knowledge of Elixir and Phoenix framework installation.\n\n```bash\nmix phx.new realtime_spreadsheet --no-ecto --live\n```\n\nWe pass the `--no-ecto` flag as we don't plan to use a database.\n\nOnce the application is generated, let's launch the server with:\n\n```bash\ncd realtime_spreadsheet\nmix phx.server\n```\n\nIf everything went well, we should be able to navigate to `http://localhost:4000/` in our web browser, where Phoenix is greeting us with a \"Welcome to Phoenix LiveView!\" message.\n\n### Creating the Spreadsheet Model and View\n\nIn Phoenix, a LiveView component is a self-contained unit that can have its own state and UI. We will create a `Spreadsheet` component to handle our spreadsheet.\n\nLet's first define the initial state of the spreadsheet. We will create a module under `lib/realtime_spreadsheet/spreadsheet.ex`.\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule RealtimeSpreadsheet.Spreadsheet do\n  defstruct spreadsheet_data: %{},\n            rows: 10, \n            cols: 10\n\n  def new() do\n    %__MODULE__{}\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWe initialize the `spreadsheet_data` map to be empty, with the number of rows and columns as specified.\n\nNow let's generate the LiveView component. We will create a component under `lib/realtime_spreadsheet_web/live/` directory.\n\n```bash\ncd lib/realtime_spreadsheet_web/live/\nmix phx.gen.live Spreadsheet\nres # this command generates the Spreadsheet component\n```\n\nThis command will generate a simple LiveView component that displays the message \"This is the Spreadsheet LiveView\". We will modify it to display the actual spreadsheet instead.\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule RealtimeSpreadsheetWeb.SpreadsheetLive do\n  use Phoenix.LiveView\n\n  # Static assigns used by render and template tags\n  @impl true\n  def render(assigns) do\n    ~L\"\"\"\n    <h1>Spreadsheet</h1>\n    <table>\n      <%= for i <- 1..@rows do %>\n        <tr>\n          <%= for j <- 1..@cols do %>\n            <td>\n              <%=\n              # TODO: Put the content of each cell here\n              \"\" %>\n            </td>\n          <% end %>\n        </tr>\n      <% end %>\n    </table>\n    \"\"\"\n  end\n\n  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do\n    {:ok, assign(socket, rows: 10, cols: 10)}\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Displaying the Spreadsheet\n\nNow we need to tell Phoenix to display our `Spreadsheet` component. Open the `lib/realtime_spreadsheet_web/router.ex` file and add the following:\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule RealtimeSpreadsheetWeb.Router do\n  use RealtimeSpreadsheetWeb, :router\n\n  #...\n\n  scope \"/\", RealtimeSpreadsheetWeb do\n    pipe_through [:browser]\n\n    live \"/\", SpreadsheetLive\n  end\nend\n```\n\nRestart the server and navigate to `http://localhost:4000/`. If everything has gone well, you should see a table with 10 rows and 10 columns displayed.\n\nThe cells in the spreadsheet are currently empty, so next, we will add the functionality for displaying cell values.\n\n### Displaying Cell Values\n\nWe will need to modify the spreadsheet's state to provide cell and row data.\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule RealtimeSpreadsheet.Spreadsheet do\n  defstruct spreadsheet_data: %{},\n            rows: 10, \n            cols: 10\n\n  def cell_value(%{row: row, col: col} = cell) do\n    Map.get(cell.spreadsheet_data, {row, col}, \"\")\n  end\n\n  def row_values(spreadsheet, row) do\n    for col <- 1..spreadsheet.cols, into: [] do\n      spreadsheet |> cell_value(%{row: row, col: col})\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWe have defined two functions that retrieve cell and row data from `spreadsheet_data`. \n\nNow we need to update the `SpreadsheetLive` module to use the data provided by the spreadsheet component.\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule RealtimeSpreadsheetWeb.SpreadsheetLive do\n  use Phoenix.LiveView\n\n  # ...\n\n  def render(assigns) do\n    {rows, cols} = assigns\n\n    ~L\"\"\"\n    <h1>Spreadsheet</h1>\n    <table>\n      <%= for i <- 1..@rows do %>\n        <tr>\n          <%= for j <- 1..@cols do %>\n            <td>\n              <%= @spreadsheet.row_values(i) |> Enum.at(j) %>\n            </td>\n          <% end %>\n        </tr>\n      <% end %>\n    </table>\n    \"\"\"\n  end\n\n  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do\n    {:ok, assign(socket, spreadsheet: Spreadsheet.new(), rows: 10, cols: 10)}\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWe include a call to `Spreadsheet.new()` in the `mount` function to instantiate a new `Spreadsheet` instance, and then we pass it to our assigns. \n\nWhen we navigate to our application, we should now see the empty cells in the spreadsheet.\n\nNext, we will add the ability to edit individual cells.\n\n### Modifying Cell Values\n\nWe will now add an event to our LiveView that listens for user input events in the cells. When the user edits a cell, the value is updated in the spreadsheet and propagated to all other clients.\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule RealtimeSpreadsheetWeb.SpreadsheetLive do\n  use Phoenix.LiveView\n\n  # ...\n\n  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do\n    {:ok, assign(socket, spreadsheet: Spreadsheet.new(), rows: 10, cols: 10)}\n  end\n\n  def handle_event(\"cell_edited\", %{\"row\" => row_str, \"col\" => col_str, \"value\" => value}, socket) do\n    row = String.to_integer(row_str)\n    col = String.to_integer(col_str)\n\n    Spreadsheet.update_cell(socket.assigns.spreadsheet, row, col, value)\n\n    {:noreply, socket}\n  end\n\n  def render(assigns) do\n    {rows, cols} = assigns\n\n    ~L\"\"\"\n    <h1>Spreadsheet</h1>\n    <table>\n      <%= for i <- 1..@rows do %>\n        <tr>\n          <%= for j <- 1..@cols do %>\n            <td>\n              <div class=\"cell\" phx-key=\"<%= i %>x<%= j %>\"\n                   phx-click=\"cell_clicked\"\n                   phx-value-row=\"<%= i %>\"\n                   phx-value-col=\"<%= j %>\">\n                <%= @spreadsheet.row_values(i) |> Enum.at(j) %>\n              </div>\n            </td>\n          <% end %>\n        </tr>\n      <% end %>\n    </table>\n    \"\"\"\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWe define the function `handle_event` to listen for a cell edited event. Then, in the `render` function, we add a `div` element with a click event to each cell. We pass the row and column of the clicked cell as payload.\n\nLastly, we add a function `Spreadsheet.update_cell` to update the `spreadsheet_data` map with the new value.\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule RealtimeSpreadsheet.Spreadsheet do\n  #...\n\n  def update_cell(spreadsheet, row, col, value) do\n    updated_values = Map.put(spreadsheet.spreadsheet_data, {row, col}, value)\n    %{spreadsheet | spreadsheet_data: updated_values}\n  end\nend\n```\n\n### Displaying Changes to Other Users\n\nWhen a user edits a cell, we need to propagate the change to all connected clients. We can do this very easily in Phoenix LiveView with just a few lines of code.\n\nOur `SpreadsheetLive` component already has an automatically created channel with a topic that is based on the URL path of the LiveView component. This channel is used to propagate events from the server to all connected clients for that specific LiveView component.\n\nWe need to modify our handle_event function to broadcast the cell edited event to all connected clients through this channel.\n\n```elixir\ndefmodule RealtimeSpreadsheetWeb.SpreadsheetLive do\n  use Phoenix.LiveView\n\n  #...\n\n  def handle_event(\"cell_edited\", %{\"row\" => row_str, \"col\" => col_str, \"value\" => value}, socket) do\n    row = String.to_integer(row_str)\n    col = String.to_integer(col_str)\n\n    spreadsheet = Spreadsheet.update_cell(socket.assigns.spreadsheet, row, col, value)\n\n    {:noreply, socket |> assign(spreadsheet: spreadsheet) |> push_event(\"cell_edited\", %{ row: row, col: col, value: value })}\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWe call the `push_event` function with the payload to broadcast the `cell_edited` event to all connected clients.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nIn this post, we have seen how Elixir and Phoenix LiveView can be used to build real-time web applications with very little client-side code. We built a real-time collaborative spreadsheet application as an example, but LiveView can be used for any number of use cases that require real-time updates. Thanks to Elixir's concurrency model, we can achieve these real-time updates without the usual performance costs of websockets and manual DOM rendering updates. With Phoenix LiveView, Elixir provides a powerful toolset for building highly concurrent, reactive web applications."
