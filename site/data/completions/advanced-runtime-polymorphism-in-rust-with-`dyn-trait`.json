     "content": "# Advanced Runtime Polymorphism in Rust with `dyn Trait`\nTags: Rust, Programming Paradigms, Object-Oriented Programming\n\n---\n\n## Introduction\n\nIn systems programming, polymorphism is a powerful tool to abstract and encapsulate different behaviors under a unified interface. In Rust, the same concept can be leveraged using `dyn Trait`, which provides a pathway for runtime polymorphism -- representing different types as a single type at runtime. This blog post explores the advanced uses of `dyn Trait` in expressing runtime polymorphism in Rust.\n\n## Understanding `dyn Trait`\n\nIn Rust, `Traits` are a way to define functionality that types can implement. Rust also allows traits to be used as types via the `dyn Trait` syntax.\n\n```rust\ntrait Drawable {\n    fn draw(&self);\n}\n\nstruct Circle {}\nstruct Square {}\n\nimpl Drawable for Circle {\n    fn draw(&self) {\n        println!(\"Drawing a Circle\");\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Drawable for Square {\n    fn draw(&self) {\n        println!(\"Drawing a Square\");\n    }\n}\n\n...\n\nfn main() {\n    let shapes: Vec<Box<dyn Drawable>> = vec![Box::new(Circle {}), Box::new(Square {})];\n    for shape in shapes {\n        shape.draw();\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the code snippet above, `Drawable` is a Trait defined with a method `draw`. We then define two structs, `Circle` and `Square`, and implement the `Drawable` trait for each. Now, we can store a vector of `Drawable` trait objects — representing our differing `Circle` and `Square` types under a unified interface.\n\n## Method Resolution\n\nIn runtime polymorphism, since the exact type of the object is not known until runtime, method resolution also happens at runtime.\n\n```rust\ntrait Printable {\n    fn print_type(&self);\n}\n\nstruct Integer(i32);\nstruct Float(f32);\n\nimpl Printable for Integer {\n    fn print_type(&self) {\n        println!(\"I'm an Integer\");\n    }\n}\n\nimpl Printable for Float {\n    fn print_type(&self) {\n        println!(\"I'm a Float\");\n    }\n}\n\nfn print(printable: Box<dyn Printable>) {\n    printable.print_type();\n}\n\n...\n\nfn main() {\n    let my_int = Box::new(Integer(10));\n    let my_float = Box::new(Float(10.0));\n    print(my_int);\n    print(my_float);\n}\n```\n\nIn the snippet above, we have a `Printable` trait implemented by `Integer` and `Float`. The concrete type wrapped in the `Box<dyn Printable>` is known only at runtime. Therefore, when `print_type` is called, Rust determines which implementation to invoke dynamically.\n\n## Size and Performance Implications\n\nOne critical thing to recognize is that there is a certain overhead associated with runtime polymorphism. Each `Box<dyn Trait>` has an associated vtable defined at runtime. The vtable has function pointers to each trait method for the actual type. This additional indirection contributes to CPU cache misses, which can have performance implications, especially in mission-critical, high-performance systems.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo sum up, runtime polymorphism with `dyn Trait` allows us to write code that is flexible and expressive. However, as with any programming tool or technique, it is essential to understand the implications — across code clarity, encapsulation, size, and performance — carefully making the tradeoffs where they make sense."
