     "content": "## Building a Highly Scalable and Fault-Tolerant Load Balancer with Rust\n\nTags: Rust, Load Balancer, Fault Tolerance, Networking\n\nAs systems scale, it becomes necessary to add additional nodes or machines to handle the added work. One of the popular ways to handle this is to have a load balancer which distributes requests among multiple machines in order to increase the system's capacity, availability, and scalability. Furthermore, as workloads become mission-critical, it is important to ensure that systems are resilient to hardware outages and network failures. Building upon the concepts we covered in our previous post on high-performance HTTP proxies, we explore how to build a highly scalable and fault-tolerant load balancer with Rust and its asynchronous ecosystem. \n\n### Architecture\n\nA common pattern in building load balancers is to have a frontend which handles incoming requests and distributes them across a pool of backend machines. The frontend machine can run a web server to receive incoming traffic, and typically listens on port 80 or 443. In order to handle the requests, the frontend maintains a list of backend machines, and typically uses a load balancing algorithm such as round-robin or least connections to distribute traffic. The frontend can also handle SSL encryption and decryption, and pass decrypted traffic to the backend machines.\n\n![Load Balancer Architecture](https://i.imgur.com/vmJ0J8w.png)\n\nIn the diagram, we see two frontend machines which front two backend machines. The frontend machines are routed requests by a hardware or cloud load balancer, or a DNS-based load balancer. The two frontend machines may either be active-active, or active-passive, depending on our resilience requirements.\n\n### Implementation\n\nTo get started, we'll use [Tokio](https://tokio.rs/) and [Hyper](https://hyper.rs/) to build the load balancer. We'll create two structs representing the frontend address and the backend address, and maintain a list of backend addresses. Upon receiving an incoming request, we'll select a backend address using our load balancing algorithm, then proxy the request to the selected address.\n\n```rust\nuse std::net::SocketAddr;\nuse hyper::{Body, Request, Response, Server};\nuse hyper::service::{make_service_fn, service_fn};\nuse futures_util::future;\nuse rand::seq::SliceRandom;\n\nstruct Frontend {\n    addr: SocketAddr,\n}\nstruct Backend {\n    addr: SocketAddr,\n}\n\nimpl Backend {\n    async fn handle_request(&self, req: Request<Body>) -> Result<Response<Body>, hyper::Error> {\n        // handle the request\n    }\n}\n\nasync fn handle_frontend_request(frontends: Vec<Backend>, req: Request<Body>) -> Result<Response<Body>, hyper::Error> {\n    let backend = frontends.choose(&mut rand::thread_rng()).unwrap();\n    backend.handle_request(req).await\n}\n\n#[tokio::main]\nasync fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error + Send + Sync>> {\n    let frontends = vec![\n        Frontend { addr: \"0.0.0.0:8000\".parse().unwrap() },\n        Frontend { addr: \"0.0.0.0:8001\".parse().unwrap() },\n    ];\n\n    let mut servers = vec![];\n    for frontend in frontends {\n        let frontends_clone = frontends.clone();\n        let server = Server::bind(&frontend.addr).serve(make_service_fn(move |_socket| {\n            let frontends_clone = frontends_clone.clone();\n            async move {\n                Ok::<_, hyper::Error>(service_fn(move |req| {\n                    handle_frontend_request(frontends_clone.clone(), req)\n                }))\n            }\n        }));\n        servers.push(server);\n    }\n    future::try_join_all(servers.into_iter().map(|server| server)).await?;\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n```\n\nIn the code, we see that we created a Frontend struct representing the frontend machine, and a Backend struct representing the backend machine. We also created a handle_request method to be called on the backend machines to handle incoming HTTP requests. In handle_frontend_request, we randomly choose a backend machine to handle each incoming request. We also created two frontend instances, then created a server for each frontend to listen for incoming requests.\n\n### Resiliency and Fault Tolerance\n\nIn a real-world application, it is essential to design the system to be resilient to hardware and network failures. One way to achieve resilience is to use [CHAOS engineering](https://principlesofchaos.org/) to intentionally inject faults, and simulate outages to test our system's behavior. We can also use [Heartbeat messages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(computing)) to monitor backend machines for availability. We can add a timer to each backend to periodically send a heartbeat message to the frontend, and if the frontend doesn't receive any responses within a certain time frame, it can mark the backend as down, and stop routing requests to it. It can also start a new instance of the backend machine to replace the failed instance.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWe have shown how to build a highly scalable and fault-tolerant load balancer with Rust and its asynchronous ecosystem using Tokio and Hyper. While we have used round-robin for our load balancing algorithm, there are other load balancing algorithms which we can use in our system such as least connections, IP hash, or consistent hash. We have also talked about the importance of designing for resiliency and fault tolerance. To achieve this, we may consider using techniques such as CHAOS engineering and heartbeat messages to continuously test, monitor, and improve our systems."
