     "content": "# A Deep Dive into ngrx/effects: An Angular Side Effect Model\nTags: Angular, ngrx/effects, Functional Programming\n\nIn today's post, we'll be taking a comprehensive look at `ngrx/effects`, an Angular library that tackles side effects within applications in a functional, reactive way. We'll dive deep into the technical aspects of this library and see how it uses the Redux pattern in combination with RxJS observables to manage side effects cleanly and effectively.\n\n## Introduction to Side Effects\n\nIn functional programming, a side effect is any operation that modifies the state of the software outside of its local environment.\n\n```typescript\nlet count = 0;\n\nfunction increment() {\n    count++;\n}\n```\n\nIn the above example, `increment` function is causing a side effect by modifying the `count` variable that is outside of the function's scope.\n\nThere's a consensus in the software development community that side effects can make programs harder to understand, predict, and debug. So, there's a growing movement towards isolating and controlling side effects within programs. This is where `ngrx/effects` comes into the picture, offering a model for handling side effects in a predictable manner within Angular applications.\n\n## ngrx/effects\n\n`ngrx/effects` is a library that provides APIs to interact with side effects originating from the Angular Components. It follows the Redux pattern, unifying side effects into actions and handling them in a predictable and consistent manner.\n\nConsider a basic example where a button click in an Angular component leads to an HTTP request, a typical side effect, to fetch some data from an API.\n\n```typescript\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\nimport {HttpClient} from '@angular/common/http';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'my-app',\n    template: `\n        <button (click)=\"fetchData()\">Fetch Data</button>\n    `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n    constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}\n\n    fetchData() {\n        this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data').subscribe(data => {\n            console.log(data);\n        });\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIn the above scenario, we are directly subscribing to the observable returned from the call to HttpClient's `get` method and logging the response data. With `ngrx/effects`, we can handle this side effect in a cleaner and predictable way.\n\n## Integrating ngrx/effects into Angular Applications\n\nFirstly, we need to install the `@ngrx/effects` package via npm.\n\n```bash\nnpm install @ngrx/effects\n```\n\nNow, we'll create an action to represent the button click.\n\n```typescript\nimport { createAction } from '@ngrx/store';\n\nexport const fetchData = createAction('[App Component] Fetch Data');\n```\n\nWe'll also create actions to handle the success and failure scenarios of the HTTP request.\n\n```typescript\nimport { createAction, props } from '@ngrx/store';\n\nexport const fetchDataSuccess = createAction(\n    '[App Component] Fetch Data Success', \n    props<{ data: any }>()\n);\n\nexport const fetchDataFailure = createAction(\n    '[App Component] Fetch Data Failure', \n    props<{ error: any }>()\n);\n```\n\nWe utilize `props` function to include additional information (payload) with the action.\n\nNext, we'll create an effect that listens for the `fetchData` action, makes the HTTP request, and dispatches either the `fetchDataSuccess` or `fetchDataFailure` action depending on the result.\n\n```typescript\nimport { Injectable } from '@angular/core';\nimport { Actions, createEffect, ofType } from '@ngrx/effects';\nimport { catchError, map, mergeMap } from 'rxjs/operators';\nimport { HttpClient } from '@angular/common/http';\nimport * as actions from './app.actions';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class AppEffects {\n    fetchData$ = createEffect(() =>\n        this.actions$.pipe(\n            ofType(actions.fetchData),\n            mergeMap(() => this.http.get('https://api.example.com/data')\n                .pipe(\n                    map(data => actions.fetchDataSuccess({ data })),\n                    catchError(error => actions.fetchDataFailure({ error }))\n                )\n            )\n        )\n    );\n\n    constructor(\n        private actions$: Actions,\n        private http: HttpClient\n    ) {}\n}\n```\n\nFinally, we'll modify the AppComponent to dispatch the `fetchData` action when the button is clicked.\n\n```typescript\nimport {Component} from '@angular/core';\nimport { Store } from '@ngrx/store';\nimport * as actions from './app.actions';\n\n@Component({\n    selector: 'my-app',\n    template: `\n        <button (click)=\"fetchData()\">Fetch Data</button>\n    `,\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n    constructor(private store: Store) {}\n\n    fetchData() {\n        this.store.dispatch(actions.fetchData());\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis decouples the interaction with the HTTP API from the `AppComponent` and provides clear, explicit declaration of side effects happening in the application.\n\nNotice how ngrx/effects merges the streams of actions into a single, unified model of interactions within the application. This model provides several benefits such as better testability, better state management, and better control over the order of operations.\n\nIn conclusion, ngrx/effects provides powerful abstractions to handle side effects in Angular applications, ensuring that effects are isolated and handled in a consistent and predictable manner. By combining actions, reducers, and effects, we can ensure a unidirectional and consistent handling of asynchronous operations in our Angular applications.\n"
